An artificial intelligent agent was created to use custom heuristics and Alpha-Beta pruning to play Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe in real-time with added custom rules to increase complexity. The project was completed as a part of the Artificial Intelligence coursework at IIIT Hyderabad. The code allows for human-human games, human-bot games and bot-bot simulations.
