The script was designed to make it easy for IIIT Hyderabad's Entrepreneurship Cell to send out marketing and promotional mails. Though over time, I've found it's application in multiple other areas and so have others.

HTML Rich content can be sent along with attachments to a pre-defined dataset of emails.
