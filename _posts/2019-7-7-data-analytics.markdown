This project was undertaken as a Research Assistant at the National Taiwan University, Taipei, over a two month stay during the summers of 2019, under the guidance of professor Hendrik Rommeswinkel. I worked on a large-scale consumer behavior database that tracked 60,000+ US families' expenditure on all goods for a period of 14 years, and assisted the development of a data analytics codebase in R to draw inferences on the said database.

The main goal was to analyze trends in consumer freedom by looking at various data points and parameters collected in the extensive 14 years long study. Besides development on the codebase, my role also involved a ground-up understanding of data analytics, practical trends in data sciences and applied statistics. I took up online courses on these topics and learned quite a lot, actually.

The codebase and the database are proprietary hence can't be shared online, though in summary, a productive summer with an interesting project! Do checkout my upcoming blog post on my stay in Taipei on this website.
