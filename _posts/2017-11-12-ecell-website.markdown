In the November of 2016, when I was first asked to work on a new website for the Entrepreneurship Cell, it was a challenging project. I had never created a complete website, equipped with a functional backend before, and spearheading a project like this one, while being in my first year was intimidating.

Though when we started working, things fell into place, and over the course of the Summers of 2017, we completed the webiste. Learning a lot about Django, the framework in which its deployed along the way. I presently head the Corporate Relations and Technological Front of the Entrepreneurship Cell at IIIT Hyderabad.

You can find the webiste [here.][website]{:target="_blank"}, while the source code for the site is available openly [here.][github]{:target="_blank"}.
