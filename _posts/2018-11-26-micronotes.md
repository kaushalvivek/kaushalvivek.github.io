Before every exam, exactly the night before it, I prepare a checklist of things to study. Occasionally with micro-notes. I felt this might be useful to someone looking to explore those topics, or studying for the same exam, if you happen to be at IIIT. So, I've created a repository of notes and checklists that I hope people would find useful.

For any other course material, feel free to mail me at [vivek.kaushal@outlook.com](mailto:vivek.kaushal@outlook.com)
