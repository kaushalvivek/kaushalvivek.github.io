**72Hours** is a full featured shopping portal that was created in the spring semester of my first year as a part of the Information Technology Workshop II coursework by a team of four people.  If you find the name of the project interesting, it's because we ended up doing a semester project over the course of 72 hours after we went camping during our project evaluation dates accidently.

Django is used as the backend, with Materialize used frontend development. The basic goal, and our motive behind building this web-application is to provide a portal to users which enables them to sell applications and also provides them the option to browse products, on the lines of quikr.com.

## Features
- User can create account
- User can Sign-In
- Create Ads for Items to Sell
- Browse through categories to see ads for items on sale
- Contact Seller to negotiate for item price
- User can search items according to category
- User can remove posted ads
