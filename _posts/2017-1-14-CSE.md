The idea behind this project is to create a useful archive of implemented algorithms for IIIT Hyderabad first year students. Although almost all codes are available online at various sources, rarely are they simplified enough for easy understanding of someone who's just beginning to code.

This project was started in my late first year itself and we contributed enthusiastically to it towards our second year's monsoon semester.

You can find more details on the project at it's repository [here](https://github.com/kaushalvivek/CSE_Algorithms)
