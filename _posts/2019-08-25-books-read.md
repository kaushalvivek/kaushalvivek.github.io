I've never been an avid reader, though I've been reading books since middle school, every now and then. There was a long hiatus in the final years of my high-school, which ended recently after an year in college. Earlier my focus was largely on fiction, popular culture etc, it has gradually moved to non-fiction, behavioural studies, self-help.

Attached, is a sheet of all the books I've ever read. If any row is marked in green, it implies that I am currently reading it. Sharing it here just in case someone is looking for recommendations. Happy reading!
