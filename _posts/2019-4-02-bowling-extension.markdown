Built upon the previous refactoring of existing codebase, an extension of the project was the addition of interactive features and by-and-large gamification of the entire application. Multiple additions were made to the codebase while keeping *Interactive nature of the application*, its *Extensibility, Configurability* and *adherence to Software Design Patterns* in mind.

The codebase was worked upon by a team of three, with over a 1000 lines of code added to the existing codebase with strict adherence to our decided 4 salient features. Documentation for the codebase and additions can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTHAi5TtJ9hPjHOqqB4LsiEi_WcRg9m55GjupitZjDLQF1mupOS1pws2d2pjMWbxbL15ER9fd_nieu7/pub)
