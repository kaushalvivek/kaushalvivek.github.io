Over the last couple of years, I've read a bunch of interesting research papers in a wide selection of topics ranging from decision making, human behaviour and neuroeconomics to computer human interaction among a few other topics. I haven't been able to publish many of these intersting papers on my blog as frequently as I would have liked. So I've created this website, which is essentially an archive of research papers in my area of work with their abstract, download links and occasionally my comments. I hope they would be of interest to someone who plans to start working on decision making research from a computer science background!

The website is available at [vivekkaushalcom/papers](http://vivekkaushal.com/papers).

The development repository is open sourced at [https://github.com/kaushalvivek/papers/](https://github.com/kaushalvivek/papers/).
