Megathon is one of the largest student hackathons in India. I have been involved with Megathon since started way back in 2016. I was a volunteer and tech team member in my first year, headed the technical and web development team in my second year *(Megathon'17)*, and rebranded the entire event while heading it at the Overall Head of E-Cell, IIIT Hyderabad in my third year *(Megathon'18)*.

The website I created for Megathon'17 is plain HTML/CSS, though I list it here as it holds a lot of nostalgic value. It was probably the first largescale individual project that I undertook, and getting 60,000+ hits on a page that I coded was a huge emotional rush.
