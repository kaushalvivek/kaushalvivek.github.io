I started working on a WhatsApp automation script because my parents are really active there, and I wanted to do something nice for them. Like sending the customized messages every morning relevant to the day by scraping data from google results etc. I came across [Mukul Hase's Web-WhatsApp-Wrapper](https://github.com/kaushalvivek/WebWhatsapp-Wrapper) and initially built the project around it. Great work there, he's a senior at my college.

[This repository](https://github.com/kaushalvivek/WhatsApp-Autotext) is a very basic skeletal version of the automation script that I envisioned. It's tested out for functionality, will soon be adding scrapers for better utility.
