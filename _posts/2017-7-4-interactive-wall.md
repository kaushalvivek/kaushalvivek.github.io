Interactive Wall is a standalone advertising platform that was built for interactive real-world advertising. Support for android and iOS based devices was provided for interactive advertising using visual datapoints parsed by Vuforia engine in Unity3D. Presently used by 20+ consumer focussed companies.

Some of the clients include Royal Challengers Bangalore, Budweiser, Star, VH1 Supersonic among others.

The project was done for [Wowsome](https://wowso.me), a mixed reality innovation startup as a software development internship. The code is proprietary.
