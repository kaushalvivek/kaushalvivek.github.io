Before I bought a student subscription of Apple Music, Youtube was my primary source of music, as it is for a large percentage of the population, at least in my college. So I thought of this app, coded it in a caffine drenched night, and released it the next morning.

This application is a simple music downloader. You enter the name of an artist, the song you want to download, and it finds that song for you (scraping Youtube), downloads it and neatly stores it organised by Artists.

The reception was surprisingy nice. People liked it, so I added a few extra features, such as song suggestions for any artist and more customisability.

You can find the code for this application [here][github-music-downloader]{:target="_blank"}, it's an ongoing Open Source project, so feel free to contribute!
