I took this course in the summer of 2019 for my work in big-data analysis at the National Taiwan University, Taipei. I felt the course was a really good starting point for anyone who wants to build upon high-school statistics knowledge, and it required bare-minimum pre-requisites.

The notes are handwritten and divided into 4 sections, one for each week of the coursera course. You can find them here:
