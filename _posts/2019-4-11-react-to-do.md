I've started learning React as a part of my effort to master React and Flutter over the course of next couple of months. This is a simple to-do app created as a part of a learning react.

### Functionalities :

- Add to-do
- Display to-dos
- Cross off to-do
- Show number of active to-dos
- filters for all/inactive/active to-dos
- Mark to-dos as complete
- Delete button for todos

### Pre-requisites:
- Node
- React 

### Usage :

- Clone the repository or download a zip, [link to repo.](https://github.com/kaushalvivek/react-to-do/)
- Navigate to the root ```to-do/``` folder
- Run:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Run :
  ```
  npm start
  ```

Based on the tutorial:

[Practical React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6IY2TqnPDA&t=464s) course by Ben Awad.
