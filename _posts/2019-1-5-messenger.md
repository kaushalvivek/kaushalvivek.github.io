Messenger remains a huge part of how my immediate community interacts and functions. I started contributing to [Tahoon Kim's](https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat) unofficial messenger API for pythonic development when I found a bug in its implementation while scripting a cronjob to notify people who share Netflix with me to pay up fast every month. :P

Have some major ideas planned for the project, and am also working on multiple automation projects based on the unofficial API. Great community of passionate developers, love being a part of it!
