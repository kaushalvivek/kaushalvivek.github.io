Though I find the course redundant for someone who isn't eventually going to venture into Computer Vision, I can't deny that fact that Graphics' assignments give a vague sense of achievement, creating games is fun.

This 2 dimensional game is a classic Pacman ball game with the objective of destroying incoming balls while staying away from procupines.

Controls
----------

-**Movement :**
- 'Left' for Moving Ball to Left
- 'Right' for Moving Ball to Right
- 'Up' for Moving Ball to Up
- 'Down' for Moving Ball to Down

-**Zoom and Pan :**
- Scroll for Zoom
- 'W' for pan Up
- 'S' for pan Down
- 'A' for pan Left
- 'D' for pan Right

Details
--------

- **Scoring and Health :**
- 10 points for hitting a ball.
- Health decreases on touching the porcupine.


Compilation and Running
------------------------------
```
./compile.sh
```
and then
```
./first_test
```
to run the game.

_PS: This game with run on OS X only, as the compilation has been done keeping that in mind._
