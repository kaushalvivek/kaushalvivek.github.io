Sentinel is a standalone cross-platform ticketing application coded in C# using Unity3D with Vuforia engine for image tracking and identification. Backend integration with ASW was also embedded in the final program. The application has since been used at multiple mass-attendance events and concerts for swift ticketing without human-intervention.

Some of the clients include Royal Challengers Bangalore, Budweiser, Star, VH1 Supersonic among others.

The project was done for [Wowsome](https://wowso.me), a mixed reality innovation startup as a software development internship. The code is proprietary.
