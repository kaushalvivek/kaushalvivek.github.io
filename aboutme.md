Hello, my name is **Vivek Kaushal** and I am a **research student** at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://iiit.ac.in). I work with the Cognitive Sciences Lab here, and presently, my primary area of interests include *neuroeconomics, risk, financial decision making and entrepreneurship.*

Ever since I was a kid, I've liked solving problems; and that makes me very fond of how code empowers you to do really cool things with computers. I am a **hobbyist developer**, but my true calling lies in finding innovative ways to solve problems in interesting fields.

Right now, I am working on models to provide a better understanding of human behavior, specifically in financial decisions. Though I look forward to new opportunities and challenges in **Behavioral Economics** and other different fields.  
Eager to experiment and learn. :)

There's more that I want to tell you about me.  
But I know that your attention span is limited, so I'll restrict myself to a few pictures.

### Music

I grew up listening to beautiful old Bollywood songs thanks to my dad; was trained for 5 years in Classical Indian music, then rebelled by picking up a guitar and embracing western culture. I listen to almost eveything, from Zeppelin to alt-J, Guns n Roses to Coldplay, with everything in between. Pink Floyd is my favourite artist, and no.  
Rap is not music. Okay, maybe a couple of guilty pleasures, but that's it.

### Travel

Travel brings you closer to yourself. It's simple really, when you've met enough people from all around, who are poles apart yet somehow very much the same, you understand basic human traits. It just gives a clearer worldview and helps you understand human behavior. The picture doesn't reflect the gravity of my thoughts here, but I wanted a picture in that hat ever since *Joey* wore it in *Friends.*

### Technology

This here, is Dr.Charles Severance. I met him recently at a conference, and he represents, better than anyone else, how technology can empower people. Dr.Severance has written books, designed courses and tutorials that have taught more people on this planet how to code, than possibly anyone else. And here he is, casually poking humour at small iPhones and making fun of my iPhone SE's camera for being crappy, after he told me how he plans on changing the education system in middle schools.

### Gym

I started working out to earn compulsory college credits. Then it was about proving a point to myself. Now, I do it because it works better than caffeine in boosting my energy levels and motivation.  

And yes. I like to blog to get my views and ideas out there. So do check this site out often.
