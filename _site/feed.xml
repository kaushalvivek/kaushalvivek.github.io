&lt;p&gt;This post is about &lt;strong&gt;Taipei&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date of Visit&lt;/strong&gt;    : 26th May, 2019&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Duration of Stay&lt;/strong&gt; : 60 days&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a fan of architecture per se, but I can faintly trace my fascination with skyscrapers to late 2005, flipping through an edition of Whitaker’s World Fact-book, there was a list of top 10 tallest buildings in the world, and right there on the top was Taipei 101, the world’s tallest skyscraper in 2005, along with a picture. &lt;em&gt;509 meters, wow.&lt;/em&gt; As a kid, I couldn’t imagine a building half a kilometer high, it sounded incredible. I wanted to see it to be sure. And right there, right then, was my earliest itch to travel. That memory stuck around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years later, Taipei 101 is no longer the tallest building in the world, but I never really got over that initial fascination. It was never just about a building, it was about what it represented to me, a very early testament to human will. So when an opportunity presented itself, a chance to work at the National Taiwan University, Taipei, for a couple of months, I jumped at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I packed my bags and came to Taiwan. 4000 kms from home. For two months. A stranger in the country. Unable to speak the language. Unsure of the food. Alien to the culture. Void of a purpose. The funny thing is that I was never scared. I became aware of the fact that it was a &lt;em&gt;brave&lt;/em&gt; thing to do when people I talked to dropped their jaws over there in Taipei. I was excited, right from the moment I landed in Taiwan. I looked at the city from my Airport train window, at the buildings, the hills, a faint silhouette of Taipei 101 in the background, and the only thing I could feel was a rush of adrenaline. I’ve never felt more alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive into what makes Taipei special, I’ve curated a list of the following points through which I hope to give you some insights into my stay here. I’ve added pictures!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-food-and-culture&quot;&gt;The Food and Culture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/taipei_food.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Taipei-Food&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan has &lt;em&gt;night markets&lt;/em&gt;, magical places where you can eat the wildest delicacies at reasonable prices. For me, eating in Taiwan was filled with firsts, first frog, first squid, octopus, shrimp, clams, salmon sushi, japanese curry and a bunch of other stuff. The dumplings lived upto and exceeded my expectations, best I’ve ever had, tofu was aplenty and Taiwanese noodles a pleasant surprise. If I had to choose one meal though, it’d be hot-pot, Japanese hot-pot is pure genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is rich in culture, and I was lucky enough to be around for dragon boat racing. Admittedly diluted in urban expanses of cities like Taipei, yet Taiwanese culture was a beautiful blend of its Japanese heritage and Chinese origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-convenience&quot;&gt;The Convenience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/taipei_ubike.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Taipei-Food&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask a random stranger on the streets what’s the best thing they like about Taipei, and there’s a strong possibility that they’ll laugh awkwardly and then confess that it’s the convenience. Taipei is convenient, more so than any other city that I’ve been in. The MRT (Metro Rail Transport) system is robust, the buses are good and cheaply priced, and then there are U-bikes. It’s the perfect implementation of a city-wide bike-sharing system, and it’s extremely well-maintained. Transportation is a breeze in Taipei. 7-11s and Family Marts on every other corner are cherries on top, 24x7 access to food and every other shopping emergency is a heaven-sent. Especially when you can bike to it and be back in 10 mins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-art-and-history&quot;&gt;The Art and History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/taipei_art.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Taipei-Food&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been a museum-person. I appreciate art and history, but somehow, museums don’t fascinate me, and not for a want of trying. Though I must say, Taipei has some world-class museums, with the Museum of Fine Arts being particularly exciting. It’s exhibits on sound and music, along with it’s exploration of psychedelic lights was something new. Besides museums, Taipei’s central districts like Da’an are prime examples of beautiful Japanese architecture. Phil Knight noticed in his how the japanese strive to add beauty too every facet of their existence, it shows in their architecture. Taiwan’s Japanese heritage is a noticeable and remarkable part of life in Taipei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-night-life&quot;&gt;The Night Life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/taipei_nightlife.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Taipei-Food&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Taiwan University is located in the heart of the city, a couple of metro stops away from Taipei 101 and a walk away from all the nice bars and clubs of the city. I had a great time at the Gonguang Riverside, a string of beautiful small bars in Taipei right next to the Tamsui river, where you can sit with a couple of beers, chat up with people from all over the world, share stories, dance to good music and wait for the sunrise. Bonus : an amazing dumpling breakfast awaits you, if you can sit tight till 6:00am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-music&quot;&gt;The Music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/taipei_music.png&quot; alt=&quot;Taipei-Food&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be a wee-bit touristy, but street artists are an integral part of any city, in my personal opinion. Taipei does not disappoint, not at all. I saw artists performing rock classics to traditional chinese music and everything in between on the streets. Whether it be the city centres of Yuanshan or tourist hotspots like Tamsui and Shilin, live music was always a pleasure on the streets of Taipei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-people&quot;&gt;The People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/taipei_people.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Taipei-Food&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am hesitant in generalizing statements about large sections of the population based on the few interactions that I’ve had in a place, but I must say, the people that I interacted with in Taipei were amongst the nicest and politest people I’ve met. Taipei’s high ranks in security and low crime rates are visible in its law abiding citizens. A lot of factors influence your choice of living in a city, for me, its important for the place to be cosmopolitan, I enjoy talking to people from different walks of life at a local bar or over a bowl of noodles, and Taipei is cosmopolitan, increasingly so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weekend-getaways&quot;&gt;Weekend Getaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/taipei_fulong.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Taipei-Food&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taipei has a large variety of weekend Getaways to offer, ranging from beautiful beaches to lush green mountains, with everything in between. A bonus addition is an active volcano at the Yang Ming Shang national park, a short drive from Taipei. The attached picture is from a lazy Saturday out at the Fulong beach with some friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-university&quot;&gt;The University&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/taipei_ntu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Taipei-Food&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranked among the top 100 universities in the world, the National Taiwan University is breath-takingly beautiful, and a tourist attraction in itself. I would legit miss sitting next to the Drunken Moon lake on a sunny day with a good book and just watching the day pass by while I read. The main library is an architectural masterpiece, but probably the most intriguing on campus, for me, were the students themselves. It was inspiring to see how dedication can change your entire outlook for college, maybe it was just the people I met, maybe not, but I left with a heightened appreciation for education, and an aroused hunger to make the most of what time I have left at my university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;taipei-101&quot;&gt;Taipei 101&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/taipei_101.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Taipei-Food&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You saw it coming. This list would have incomplete without Taipei 101, of course. As luck would have it, I had a clear view of this iconic building from my dorm balcony. And an hour after checking into my dorm, I was on my way. On foot, walking towards Taipei 101, without a map. Who needs a map when you can just loop up to check your destination out. I remember pacing, as I got closer. And then I turned a corner and all of a sudden, I was there. I felt a dream being fulfilled so strongly in that moment, standing next to the Adidas 101 basketball court, where people were playing, and I looked at their obliviousness incredulously. I stood gawking at 101 for a solid 5 minutes, and after I had taken the sight in, clicked a bunch of pictures, video-called friends and family, I turned around and walked back to my dorm. I had seen Taipei 101. My 2005 self was happy. I smiled like an idiot the whole way back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/taipei_cityscape.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Taipei-Food&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned on my last day in Taiwan and climbed to the top, saw the entire city spread before me, and it felt like a homage to the last couple of months. Taipei was good to me. I learnt more about life than I  thought I could, in two months. I returned with a renewed sense of purpose, and honestly, I can’t wait to go back someday.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>vivekkaushal</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="The Metropolis Project" /><category term="Travel" /><summary type="html">This post marks the start of a new series : The Metropolis Project, in which I hope to travel the world to experience life in the the greatest urban centres on this planet, cities that are unique in certain respects, and write about my experience.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/taipei.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Papers : An Archive</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/papers-post/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Papers : An Archive" /><published>2019-07-18T02:32:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-07-18T02:32:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/papers-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/papers-post/">&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of years, I’ve read a bunch of interesting research papers in a wide selection of topics ranging from decision making, human behaviour and neuroeconomics to computer human interaction among a few other topics.

&lt;p&gt;Asked Fermi, in the summer of 1950, while having lunch with fellow physicists Teller, York and Konopinski. He was referring to the absolute lack of extra-terrestrial contact with intelligent life despite the strong probabilistic evidence of their existence in the observable universe. This question garnered fame as “Fermi’s Paradox” and several explanations have been proposed in the last 69 years without scientific consensus on any particular one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short article, I propose another such explanation, loosely based on mathematical fundamentals behind Karl Friston’s Free Energy Principle which models human behavior and brain functions on mathematical grounds of restrained entropy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;free-energy-principle-in-a-nutshell&quot;&gt;Free Energy Principle in a Nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free energy principle tries to explain how biological systems maintain their order by restricting themselves to a limited number of states. It says that biological systems minimize a free energy functional of their internal states, which entail beliefs about hidden states in their environment. In essence, it implies that biological beings try and build predictions of their environment in their minds and then act to make their environment similar to their prediction while updating their predictions themselves. The key point is survival, with the crux of theory being that we’ll survive better if we can predict accurately how our environment is going to change. You can read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-at-multi-agent-interactions&quot;&gt;Looking at Multi-Agent Interactions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Friston’s work, the external environment is modeled as an event space with only one active-agent : the living creature who’s trying to predict its environment. But what if we try to model this environment as a multi-agent event space? Can the Free Energy Principle explain how we interact with other humans, creatures and information in general?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expanding-interaction-circles-and-communication&quot;&gt;Expanding Interaction Circles and Communication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a multi-agent environment, such as ours, we can’t interact with everyone, our interaction will be bound to a small number, we’ll largely communicate with a small number of people while in existence and any information that we attain will be through this small circle of ours. This was true for thousands of years of human history, but with expanding means of communication, and converging social circles, the way we communicate is changing. My hypothesis is that the weights we assign to pieces of information while updating our internal prediction models are dwindling because of a multitude of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The sheer volume of information we consume&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presumptions on authenticity of the information&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large volume of sources that we keep tapping into&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a first look, the information revolution seems like an excellent deal. The ability to communicate with someone a continent away is nothing short of a miracle. The problem might arise when we look at the other side of the coin : our ability to contact everyone a continent away. How much do we trust our new-found social circles? How much weights do we assign to information that we gain today? Are our prediction models slowly becoming blind to the obvious and focusing on fictional stories that we can build out of the thousand sources that we have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-theory&quot;&gt;The Theory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis is that no alien civilization has contacted us because intelligent life is bound to drive itself to extinction as its communication prowess crosses a threshold after which its prediction model becomes inefficient and wrapped in a fictional sphere. This without any doubt is a hugely pessimistic outlook which implies that intelligent life will always die out because they’ll essentially stop looking at the problems that are imminent and right in front of their eyes. The way present humanity is ‘dealing’ with the threat of Global Warming makes for a good example. The United States  government denies the existence of Global Warming while an overwhelming majority in the scientific community vouches for more policy-centric focus on the threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-you-can-do&quot;&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just keep your eyes open for the next time you choose to believe a more convenient truth. You might just be setting up your brain for temporary comfort at the cost of our species’ survival. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>vivekkaushal</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Fermi's Paradox" /><category term="Theory" /><category term="Science" /><category term="Research" /><summary type="html">“But where is everybody?”</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/fermi.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Zero : A Theoretical Overview</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/zero/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Zero : A Theoretical Overview" /><published>2019-05-03T22:32:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-05-03T22:32:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/zero</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/zero/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This term paper looks at work done by different eminent researchers towards the understanding of zero – as a price and as a probability, along with our perception of zero. The concept is looked at both from an economic point of view and from a psychological angle. Theories proposed to adjust the standard economic model to better reflect human behaviour and bounded rationality, found experimentally, are also discussed. The mentioned experiments can be repeated on different demographic sections with interesting results, and remain a point of further study. The emergence of neuroeconomics to fill gaps in standard economics theory has also been explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;context&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard economic theory aims to explain macroeconomic and microeconomic observations of the world, looking into financial decisions that we make, and the implications of our decisions on larger market forces. It also attempts to theoretically deconstruct these market forces and understand their base causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Steven D. Levitt’s words, Economics can be be described as ‘a study of incentives’. This definition inherently puts economics under a cognitive lens, with the study of human behaviour gaining utmost importance, in both microeconomic and macroeconomic contexts. Yet, bizarrely enough, standard economic theory assumes humans to be perfectly rational beings, with all decisions being taken by humans under perfect or imperfect information conditions, presumed to be perfectly rational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stance of standard economic theory started being questioned in the early 1970s with the rise of psychological economists of the likes of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Questions were raised on the presumed rationality of humans in financial decision making, and a series of controlled experimentation clearly showed deviations from the standard economic theory. These experimentations and proposed models for human behaviour that could better explain human irrationality in financial decisions were clubbed under the domain of a new and upcoming field – Behavioral Economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides active work in Behavioral Economics over the past few decades, the development of a much more focused sub-domain – Neuroeconomics – has been notable. Neuroeconomics looks at financial decision making from a cognitive neuroscience perspective, evaluating experimentally observed bounded rationality of humans, based on literature available in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a contextual understanding of the domain, let’s look at work done in neuroeconomics on the concept of zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;literature-overview&quot;&gt;Literature Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel prize in Economics, in 2002 for his and Amos Tversky’s work on Prospect Theory (1979). A notable point here is that Kahneman never took a course in Economics throughout his academic career. Their paper published in 1979, among other things, also looked at the irrational behaviour people exhibit when comparing zero and near-zero probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As put in words by Dan Ariely, “Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) work on probabilities indicates that when it comes to gambles, people perceive zero probability (and certainty) substantially differently than they do small positive probabilities. That is, whereas the values of the latter are perceived as higher than they actually are, perceptions of zero probability are accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Daniel Kahneman’s ‘Thinking Fast and Thinking Slow’ he talks about two systems behind our cognitive decision making – System 1 and System 2. System 2 is the logical decision making that we do while being conscious of the process, like how you (the reader) are reading this document and understanding words and context; whereas System 1 is the force behind our intuitions – like why you (the reader) may not like this font, you did not consciously weigh the pros and cons of the font before making the decision, that’s how System 1 works, without our conscious focus.
Now here, the proposition is that System 1 is responsible for the ‘irrational’ prejudice that we have for near-zero probabilities, a more detailed explanation is available in discussions ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important point in our understanding of Zero is the context in which it is perceived. In Chicago Booth School economist Steven D. Levitt’s 2005 bestseller ‘Freakonomics’ he highlighted the differences between Market Norms and Social Norms. We follow market norms when we value things in a financial manner, whereas social norms are followed in decisions where there’s an absence of financial context – such as appreciation for home-cooked food. Levitt’s work on Market and Social norms was reiterated in Heyman and Ariely’s ‘Effort for Payment : A Tale of Two Markets’. With certain deviations from standard economic theory when dealing with Zero, explained in a social context. For example, when a class of students were asked to take chocolates, the demand was higher when the chocolates were priced, compared to when the chocolates were free. This economic abnormality can be explained by the theory on social norms, where free chocolates weren’t perceived as an economic transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In ‘Zero As a Special Price - True Value for Free Products’, Dan Ariely and Kristina Shampanier attempt to sum up existing theories on abnormalities regarding zero from an economic context while relying on experimentation to validate their hypothesis. Standard economic theory says that when faced with a choice of selecting one of several available products (or possibly buying nothing), people will choose the option with the highest cost–benefit difference. But in this paper, Dan Ariely and Kristina Shampanier propose that decisions about free products differ as people do not simply subtract costs from benefits and perceive the benefits associated with free products as higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test this radical proposal, a series of experiments were carried out while contrasting demand for two products across conditions where they maintained a constant price difference between goods, but varied the said prices such that the cheaper product in the set of products is priced at either a low positive or a zero price. The results showed a skewed demand for zero-priced products which were against the prediction of standard economic theory, and confirmed the hypothesis put forward in the paper. Thus, people appear to act as if zero pricing of a good not only decreases its cost but also adds to its benefits. These tests were both real and hypothetical in nature, and carried out on campus residents of MIT, Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this effect, several psychological antecedents of the effect were proposed as well, including social norms, mapping difficulty among others. More details on the saime are discussed in the Discussion section below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discussion&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on existing literature on the subject, we can say with a fair degree of confidence that humans aren’t perfectly rational. Prospect theory among other popular works have firmly established the bounded and contextual nature of human rationality when it comes to decision making. Taking up the study of economic theory abnormalities surrounding ‘Zero’ proved to be an excellent way to gauge various sub-domains of Behavioural Economics, and by extent human behaviour and our cognitive structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zero being perceived as a ‘social norm’ in contextual decisions highlights how our ‘System 1’ functions, and how quickly our brain is able to differentiate a financial context from a non-financial one without us being consciously aware of it. The way our brain seems to be hot-wired from birth to gauge patterns in certain respects, such as language, reading facial expressions, understanding social contexts is fascinating to say the least. These functionalities of ‘System 1’ as put by Daniel Kahneman, are built out of synaptic networks that comprise Associative Memory and is incredibly powerful and engagingly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this ‘System 1’ that give chess masters an instinctive responses to different board positions, where others will use their logical, conscious thought process. Our perception of near-zero probability and zero costs eventually boils down to this ‘System 1’ only. This rapid-decision-making functionality has been honed throughout human evolution to ensure our survival, and that involves quick decision making in situations, without a logical evaluation, when the context of the decision seems familiar. Hence, when someone gives us something for ‘free’, taking it is the instinctive reaction. It’s a risk-free decision, that on face-value and past context seems intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of how our instincts are honed, and how our brain actually functions in intuitive decision-making, while studying our understanding of ‘Zero’ has been a thought provoking venture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-scope&quot;&gt;Future Scope&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the work done by the academic community in Behavioural Economics and intuitive decision making has been phenomenal, there is still scope for further refinement and verification of concepts concerning our understanding of ‘Zero’ price and probability. Some points that I feel future studies can be built around are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looking at a younger demographic might help researchers understand some of the characteristics of intuition and help segregate environmental factors and learnt behaviour from evolutionary traits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Although microscopic transactions have been well-explored, work still needs to be done at the macroscopic level, explaining market forces from a neuroscience perspective still remain the holy grail of behavioural economics.&lt;/li&gt;
