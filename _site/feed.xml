&lt;p&gt;This post, is about &lt;em&gt;Taipei&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a fan of architecture per se, but I can faintly trace my fascination with skyscrapers to late 2005, flipping through an edition of Whitaker’s World Fact-book, there was a list of top 10 tallest buildings in the world, and right there on the top was Taipei 101, the world’s tallest skyscraper in 2005, along with a picture. &lt;em&gt;509 meters, wow&lt;/em&gt; as a kid, I couldn’t imagine a building half a kilometer high, it sounded incredible. I wanted to see it to be sure. And right there, right then, it was my earliest itch to travel. A lasting memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years later, Taipei 101 is no longer the tallest building in the world, but I never really got over that initial fascination. It was never just about a building, it was about what it represented to me, a very early impression of what we as a species can achieve. So when an opportunity presented itself, a chance to work at the National Taiwan University, Taipei, for a couple of months, I jumped at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I packed my bags and came to Taiwan. 4000 kms from home. For two months. A stranger in the country. Unable to speak the language. Unsure of the food, unsure of the culture, unsure of a purpose. The funny this is that I was never scared. I became aware of the fact that it was a &lt;em&gt;brave&lt;/em&gt; thing to do when people I talked to dropped their jaws over there in Taipei. I was excited, right from the moment I landed in Taiwan. I looked at the city from my Airport train window, at the buildings, the hills, a faint silhouette of Taipei 101 in the background, and the only thing I could feel was a rush of adrenaline. I’ve never felt more alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to bore you mid-way through this post, so I’ll limit myself to a select few points, along with pictures. So I guess this would be the template for future posts in &lt;strong&gt;The Metropolis Project&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked Fermi, in the summer of 1950, while having lunch with fellow physicists Teller, York and Konopinski. He was referring to the absolute lack of extra-terrestrial contact with intelligent life despite the strong probabilistic evidence of their existence in the observable universe. This question garnered fame as “Fermi’s Paradox” and several explanations have been proposed in the last 69 years without scientific consensus on any particular one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short article, I propose another such explanation, loosely based on mathematical fundamentals behind Karl Friston’s Free Energy Principle which models human behavior and brain functions on mathematical grounds of restrained entropy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;free-energy-principle-in-a-nutshell&quot;&gt;Free Energy Principle in a Nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free energy principle tries to explain how biological systems maintain their order by restricting themselves to a limited number of states. It says that biological systems minimize a free energy functional of their internal states, which entail beliefs about hidden states in their environment. In essence, it implies that biological beings try and build predictions of their environment in their minds and then act to make their environment similar to their prediction while updating their predictions themselves. The key point is survival, with the crux of theory being that we’ll survive better if we can predict accurately how our environment is going to change. You can read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-at-multi-agent-interactions&quot;&gt;Looking at Multi-Agent Interactions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Friston’s work, the external environment is modeled as an event space with only one active-agent : the living creature who’s trying to predict its environment. But what if we try to model this environment as a multi-agent event space? Can the Free Energy Principle explain how we interact with other humans, creatures and information in general?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expanding-interaction-circles-and-communication&quot;&gt;Expanding Interaction Circles and Communication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a multi-agent environment, such as ours, we can’t interact with everyone, our interaction will be bound to a small number, we’ll largely communicate with a small number of people while in existence and any information that we attain will be through this small circle of ours. This was true for thousands of years of human history, but with expanding means of communication, and converging social circles, the way we communicate is changing. My hypothesis is that the weights we assign to pieces of information while updating our internal prediction models are dwindling because of a multitude of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The sheer volume of information we consume&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presumptions on authenticity of the information&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large volume of sources that we keep tapping into&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a first look, the information revolution seems like an excellent deal. The ability to communicate with someone a continent away is nothing short of a miracle. The problem might arise when we look at the other side of the coin : our ability to contact everyone a continent away. How much do we trust our new-found social circles? How much weights do we assign to information that we gain today? Are our prediction models slowly becoming blind to the obvious and focusing on fictional stories that we can build out of the thousand sources that we have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-theory&quot;&gt;The Theory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis is that no alien civilization has contacted us because intelligent life is bound to drive itself to extinction as its communication prowess crosses a threshold after which its prediction model becomes inefficient and wrapped in a fictional sphere. This without any doubt is a hugely pessimistic outlook which implies that intelligent life will always die out because they’ll essentially stop looking at the problems that are imminent and right in front of their eyes. The way present humanity is ‘dealing’ with the threat of Global Warming makes for a good example. The United States  government denies the existence of Global Warming while an overwhelming majority in the scientific community vouches for more policy-centric focus on the threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-you-can-do&quot;&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just keep your eyes open for the next time you choose to believe a more convenient truth. You might just be setting up your brain for temporary comfort at the cost of our species’ survival. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>vivekkaushal</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Fermi's Paradox" /><category term="Theory" /><category term="Science" /><category term="Research" /><summary type="html">“But where is everybody?”</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/fermi.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Zero : A Theoretical Overview</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/zero/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Zero : A Theoretical Overview" /><published>2019-05-03T22:32:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-05-03T22:32:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/zero</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/zero/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This term paper looks at work done by different eminent researchers towards the understanding of zero – as a price and as a probability, along with our perception of zero. The concept is looked at both from an economic point of view and from a psychological angle. Theories proposed to adjust the standard economic model to better reflect human behaviour and bounded rationality, found experimentally, are also discussed. The mentioned experiments can be repeated on different demographic sections with interesting results, and remain a point of further study. The emergence of neuroeconomics to fill gaps in standard economics theory has also been explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;context&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard economic theory aims to explain macroeconomic and microeconomic observations of the world, looking into financial decisions that we make, and the implications of our decisions on larger market forces. It also attempts to theoretically deconstruct these market forces and understand their base causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Steven D. Levitt’s words, Economics can be be described as ‘a study of incentives’. This definition inherently puts economics under a cognitive lens, with the study of human behaviour gaining utmost importance, in both microeconomic and macroeconomic contexts. Yet, bizarrely enough, standard economic theory assumes humans to be perfectly rational beings, with all decisions being taken by humans under perfect or imperfect information conditions, presumed to be perfectly rational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stance of standard economic theory started being questioned in the early 1970s with the rise of psychological economists of the likes of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Questions were raised on the presumed rationality of humans in financial decision making, and a series of controlled experimentation clearly showed deviations from the standard economic theory. These experimentations and proposed models for human behaviour that could better explain human irrationality in financial decisions were clubbed under the domain of a new and upcoming field – Behavioral Economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides active work in Behavioral Economics over the past few decades, the development of a much more focused sub-domain – Neuroeconomics – has been notable. Neuroeconomics looks at financial decision making from a cognitive neuroscience perspective, evaluating experimentally observed bounded rationality of humans, based on literature available in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a contextual understanding of the domain, let’s look at work done in neuroeconomics on the concept of zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;literature-overview&quot;&gt;Literature Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel prize in Economics, in 2002 for his and Amos Tversky’s work on Prospect Theory (1979). A notable point here is that Kahneman never took a course in Economics throughout his academic career. Their paper published in 1979, among other things, also looked at the irrational behaviour people exhibit when comparing zero and near-zero probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As put in words by Dan Ariely, “Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) work on probabilities indicates that when it comes to gambles, people perceive zero probability (and certainty) substantially differently than they do small positive probabilities. That is, whereas the values of the latter are perceived as higher than they actually are, perceptions of zero probability are accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Daniel Kahneman’s ‘Thinking Fast and Thinking Slow’ he talks about two systems behind our cognitive decision making – System 1 and System 2. System 2 is the logical decision making that we do while being conscious of the process, like how you (the reader) are reading this document and understanding words and context; whereas System 1 is the force behind our intuitions – like why you (the reader) may not like this font, you did not consciously weigh the pros and cons of the font before making the decision, that’s how System 1 works, without our conscious focus.
Now here, the proposition is that System 1 is responsible for the ‘irrational’ prejudice that we have for near-zero probabilities, a more detailed explanation is available in discussions ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important point in our understanding of Zero is the context in which it is perceived. In Chicago Booth School economist Steven D. Levitt’s 2005 bestseller ‘Freakonomics’ he highlighted the differences between Market Norms and Social Norms. We follow market norms when we value things in a financial manner, whereas social norms are followed in decisions where there’s an absence of financial context – such as appreciation for home-cooked food. Levitt’s work on Market and Social norms was reiterated in Heyman and Ariely’s ‘Effort for Payment : A Tale of Two Markets’. With certain deviations from standard economic theory when dealing with Zero, explained in a social context. For example, when a class of students were asked to take chocolates, the demand was higher when the chocolates were priced, compared to when the chocolates were free. This economic abnormality can be explained by the theory on social norms, where free chocolates weren’t perceived as an economic transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In ‘Zero As a Special Price - True Value for Free Products’, Dan Ariely and Kristina Shampanier attempt to sum up existing theories on abnormalities regarding zero from an economic context while relying on experimentation to validate their hypothesis. Standard economic theory says that when faced with a choice of selecting one of several available products (or possibly buying nothing), people will choose the option with the highest cost–benefit difference. But in this paper, Dan Ariely and Kristina Shampanier propose that decisions about free products differ as people do not simply subtract costs from benefits and perceive the benefits associated with free products as higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test this radical proposal, a series of experiments were carried out while contrasting demand for two products across conditions where they maintained a constant price difference between goods, but varied the said prices such that the cheaper product in the set of products is priced at either a low positive or a zero price. The results showed a skewed demand for zero-priced products which were against the prediction of standard economic theory, and confirmed the hypothesis put forward in the paper. Thus, people appear to act as if zero pricing of a good not only decreases its cost but also adds to its benefits. These tests were both real and hypothetical in nature, and carried out on campus residents of MIT, Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this effect, several psychological antecedents of the effect were proposed as well, including social norms, mapping difficulty among others. More details on the saime are discussed in the Discussion section below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discussion&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on existing literature on the subject, we can say with a fair degree of confidence that humans aren’t perfectly rational. Prospect theory among other popular works have firmly established the bounded and contextual nature of human rationality when it comes to decision making. Taking up the study of economic theory abnormalities surrounding ‘Zero’ proved to be an excellent way to gauge various sub-domains of Behavioural Economics, and by extent human behaviour and our cognitive structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zero being perceived as a ‘social norm’ in contextual decisions highlights how our ‘System 1’ functions, and how quickly our brain is able to differentiate a financial context from a non-financial one without us being consciously aware of it. The way our brain seems to be hot-wired from birth to gauge patterns in certain respects, such as language, reading facial expressions, understanding social contexts is fascinating to say the least. These functionalities of ‘System 1’ as put by Daniel Kahneman, are built out of synaptic networks that comprise Associative Memory and is incredibly powerful and engagingly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this ‘System 1’ that give chess masters an instinctive responses to different board positions, where others will use their logical, conscious thought process. Our perception of near-zero probability and zero costs eventually boils down to this ‘System 1’ only. This rapid-decision-making functionality has been honed throughout human evolution to ensure our survival, and that involves quick decision making in situations, without a logical evaluation, when the context of the decision seems familiar. Hence, when someone gives us something for ‘free’, taking it is the instinctive reaction. It’s a risk-free decision, that on face-value and past context seems intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of how our instincts are honed, and how our brain actually functions in intuitive decision-making, while studying our understanding of ‘Zero’ has been a thought provoking venture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-scope&quot;&gt;Future Scope&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the work done by the academic community in Behavioural Economics and intuitive decision making has been phenomenal, there is still scope for further refinement and verification of concepts concerning our understanding of ‘Zero’ price and probability. Some points that I feel future studies can be built around are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looking at a younger demographic might help researchers understand some of the characteristics of intuition and help segregate environmental factors and learnt behaviour from evolutionary traits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Although microscopic transactions have been well-explored, work still needs to be done at the macroscopic level, explaining market forces from a neuroscience perspective still remain the holy grail of behavioural economics.&lt;/li&gt;

The emergence of neuroeconomics to fill gaps in standard economics theory has also been explored.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/career.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">To-Do WebApp in React</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/react-to-do/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="To-Do WebApp in React" /><published>2019-04-11T22:32:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-04-11T22:32:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/react-to-do</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/react-to-do/">&lt;p&gt;I’ve started learning React as a part of my effort to master React and Flutter over the course of next couple of months.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We studied financial decision-making behavior and assessed risk propensity using a career choice simulator to understand correlations between academic performance and risk propensity, academic performance and risk-intelligence, net-worth and risk behaviour. The effect of ‘brands’ on logical decision-making was also studied. The main objective of the experiment was to check the balance between logical choices and risk propensity in financial decisions. An interactive game-like app – the career choice simulator –was designed and developed as a part of the setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keywords&quot;&gt;Keywords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk; Risk Propensity; Financial Risk-Taking; Academic Performance, Risk Intelligence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk is defined as chance taken when uncertainty is involved, by weighing the probabilities of a win or loss. Human decision making includes a constant perception of risk involved. The said perception of risk is an intuitive judgement, which is different from risk assessment, the latter being a statistical analysis of a given situation with a final contemplative decision. [3] Our innate tendency to minimise loss is a potent force behind our decisions. [1] Our adeptness at evaluating choices, given context and information, based on a subjective interpretation of involved probabilities is called Risk Intelligence. [2] 
As discussed in Figner B &amp;amp; Weber EU’ 2011 [5], there are four crucial determinants of risk, them being: (a) decision between options varying in risk occurs in different domains (b) risky decisions involve different psychological processes (c) greater risks typically comes with greater returns (d) risk taking is neither a single phenomenon nor a single personality trait, and it can be motivated by various processes, not just risk attitudes [5]. Hence, Risk taking is not just an expression of a single personality trait, one’s risk propensity cannot be estimated from a  single situation as it is affected by various environmental and contextual factors. This could include conflicting motivations like greed and fear/avoidance. Observed differences in an individual’s risk taking can be driven by various parameters such as their perception of expected reward, general risk perceptions or level of risk they are willing to accept in exchange for specific returns and competitiveness in case of peer presence. Prize, price and probability of a win are three important factors in decision making under risk (Ziller, 1957). Prize here is the object or amount to be gained in a case of success (reward), price is the object or amount to be lost in a case of failure and probability of win is the chance of winning. An individual can be gain sensitive, loss sensitive and/or probability sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, it isn’t essentially a surprise that different risk taking measures (self-report, surveys, lottery choices, real world choices) do not always strongly correlate [reference]. The context and situation matter, and each event presents a different context for risk-evaluation. At the same time, the risk taking behavior as reported by various methods can give insights into the factors influencing risk taking.
This paper looks at academic performance as a possible indicator of higher risk intelligence, and examine possible correlations between academic performance and risk propensity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;section-1--structure-of-the-setup&quot;&gt;Section 1 : Structure of the Setup&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interactive browser-based game was created where the objective was to maximize one’s Net Worth by choosing a job out of the two available choices in each round. There were a total of 15 rounds, divided into 3 stages of 5 rounds each. The first stage had the metrics    Salary and Performance Cutoff associated with each job option. The second and third stages had an additional factor -  Company Name added to both the job options.
When the user selected a job in a round, a Performance Score was selected from a randomly generated predefined set. If the Performance Score was lower than the the selected job’s Performance Cutoff, a penalty amount was deducted from user’s Net Worth and he/she was lead to the next round. Else, if the Performance Score was greater than the selected job’s Performance Cutoff, then the Salary amount was added to user’s Net Worth and he/she was lead to the next round. The Performance Cutoff  was not known to the student at the time of decision-making, hence it created a scenario where decision-making happened under uncertainty, with self-estimation of risk involved based on visible information. After recording responses for all 15 rounds, users were presented with a questionnaire comprising of standard questions from the DOSPERT (reference) Scale for self-estimation of Risk Propensity in Financial and Social domains and responses were recorded. Preference order for Location, Salary and Company while choosing a job was also collected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;section-2--the-subject-of-experiment-and-its-execution&quot;&gt;Section 2 : The Subject of Experiment and its Execution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;50 sophomore Computer Science students (aged 19-21), 25 with a GPA above 8.0 and 25 with a GPA below 8.0, were asked to play the game and their response were carefully recorded.A high level of immersion was created by carefully designing a user interface which displayed relevant information in an intuitive layout. The goal was to drive the user’s attention towards the decision-making process while providing necessary information in a clean, non-intrusive manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A High Score was displayed through the gameplay to add an element of competition and peer influence to user’s decision-making in the game. Peer influence and competition have been shown to enhance risk-taking in adolescents. In each round, one job option had a high Performance Cutoff and another had a low Performance Cutoff. The Salary for both job options were different accordingly, such that a high-risk-high-reward scenario was created. In the second stage, a Company Name with a higher brand perception (reference)was added to the high-risk-high-reward job option, while a Company Name with a low reward perception  (reference), was added to the low-risk-low-reward job option. In the third stage, we did the opposite, a Company Name with a low reward perception (reference)was added to the high-risk-high-reward job option, while a Company Name with a high reward perception  reference), was added to the low-risk-low-reward job option.Comparison of performance across the three stages provided insights into the effect of brand allegiance on logical decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average in-game Net Worth of students with a GPA ≥ 8, ($1.14 million) was 30.7% higher than the average net-worth of students with a GPA &amp;lt; 8 ($0.87 million), at the end of all 15 rounds. Students with a GPA ≥ 8 took 186 high risk decisions. 10.2% lower than students with a GPA &amp;lt; 8, who took 205 high risk decisions. Students who had a lower GPA faced the penalty 99 times in the game. 43.5% higher than students with a GPA ≥ 8, who faced the penalty 69 times. A weakly negative correlation of -0.3 was observed between the DOSPERT Scale and risk-taking behavior observed in this experimental setup. (will break it up  into correlations of high and low GPA separately if needed)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;24 students (out of the 50) ranked Salary as the most important factor while choosing a job, followed by 16 for Company and 10 for Location. Average Net Worth of students who chose Company as the most important parameter in job selection was $981,000, 7% lower than the average net worth of students who chose Company as the least important parameter in selecting a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;discussion&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 30.7% higher average net-worth of students with a GPA ≥ 8 might be attributed to higher risk intelligence of students with a higher GPA. Students with lower GPA also face a penalty 43.5% more times, this can be seen in the above light or that the high performing students are better adept assessing risk-reward situations. This would bring to light a positive correlation between risk intelligence and academic performance, though further studies are necessary to establish a correlation between risk intelligence and other forms of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students with lower GPA took 10.2% more risks, an interesting result that needs to be examined with respect to the effect of  lower expectation from society and hence propensity for high risk behavior [4].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students who ranked Company as the most important factor in making job-choices had a 7\% lower net-worth than students who ranked Company as the least important factor. One can infer that allegiance to ‘brands’ interferes with the logical decision making, more studies are needed to show conclusive evidence for the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to expectations, no direct correlation was observed between net-worth of an individual and risk-taking, which indicated that the tendency to risk is independent of net-worth and people are inherently either high or low risk takers. The findings from this study highlights certain constraints of the educational and career choice expectation on Indian students. The data brings a unique testing tool for risk and goals adding to rational choice theory experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular book is special because it’s very closely related to my research. Behavioural economics is an area of research that looks closely at gaps in standard economic models when it comes to explaining human behaviour, which is often erratic and unpredictable from an economic point of view. Dr. Dan Ariely is one of the foremost visionaries of the modern world view in Behavioural economics, and through this book he breaks down the motive and nitty grittes of the field without initimidating the reader. Of all the books I’ve read, this is the most complete introduction of the field I’ve come across. The narrative is not an academic one, it’s more of a personal story, arguably even autobiographical in tone, where Dan skips through multiple experiments like a kid in a candy store while explaining the rationale behind their setting and giving insights into human behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relativity&quot;&gt;Relativity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einstein said it. All of know and accept it. But probably not quite in the manner as we sub-consciously do. Our minds are wired to compare and we rigorously do so, anything and everything we can. These comparisons lead us to questionable decision making where economic theory assumptions of our rationality fall apart. For example, the same person who travels 15 mins to buy slightly cheaper groceries from a store farther away, will probably not hesitate in spending an additional few thousands on the purchase of a new car. Does the utility of money change with context? Of course not. We just judge the extra cost by putting it next to our base purchase. A ₹3 PayTM surcharge on a ₹100 spend is not a big deal, the same charge on a ₹10  purchase is. This can be expanded beyond money to other contexts with the same basic premise. It might sound intuitive, but it goes against economic theory’s assumptions of our rationality and sees human decision making in new light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;price-anchoring&quot;&gt;Price Anchoring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand and supply are forces that regulate market prices of commodities. That’s common knowledge. But in Predictably Irrational, Ariely argues that contrary to common perception, price anchoring is a much stronger and potent force than we give it credit for. How exactly do we determine that diamonds are expensive? That property prices in a certain section of a city, or of our favourite dish on a restaurant menu is what it is supposed to be? The answer is price anchors. Our brain gets conditioned to a price point for a particular commodity and accepts it. This is the reason why people who move from smaller cities to larger cities find prices of commodities exorbitant. Why I, as an Indian and used to paying Rs. 20 for a bottle of water, find it agonisingly painful to pay a pound for a bottle of water when I travel. Price anchors are the secret drivers of demand, and they get established in an un-intuitive manner, and once they are imprinted, it’s very hard to shake them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cost-of-zero-cost&quot;&gt;Cost of Zero Cost&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, Dan explains how we treat ‘FREE’ offerings irrationally. This again plays towards our inherent bias of loss minimisation, where loss aversion is a greater motivator than the possibility of gains. The proposition of ‘FREE’ offerings makes us believe that there is no downside of a decision, i.e., no loss whatsoever, hence, we form an irrationally bias towards them. We do not realise any hidden downsides like the utility of our invested time, among others when dealing with ‘FREE’ or zero-cost offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-monetary-equivalence-of-a-friendly-favour&quot;&gt;The Monetary Equivalence of a Friendly Favour&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular point is very interesting as it isn’t quite as intuitive as others on this list. Unlike what we might be inclined to believe, monetary gratification is not always a primary driver or incentive for us to work. Dan explains this through the example of a household dinner, where compliments are socially acceptable and desirable, but monetary payments are not. Now this is common understanding, but research also shows that the same principles of ‘personal’ relationship hold strong when carefully cultivated by an employer for an employee. Implying, that personalised gifts might be a better reward to boost productivity than cash bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;emotions-in-decisions&quot;&gt;Emotions in Decisions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are emotional beings, and although we might accept sheepishly to being swayed by our emotions from time to time when taking decisions, we do not quite understand the extent of this phenomenon. Dan tested young adult decision making and risk propensity in sexual decision in normative and aroused states and the difference was incredible. In an aroused state, teens were much more likely to partake in risky sexual behaviour, beyond societal, statistical and their own expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;procrastination&quot;&gt;Procrastination&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all suffer from this uncanny bane of our generation to varying degrees. Dan setup a beautiful class experiment where he gave his students choices of varying degrees of freedom in setting their own deadlines for the course’s requirements, assignments and reports. The options included strict professor set deadlines, lax time-bound deadlines and no deadlines whatsoever, with all submissions due before the end of the course. Upon analysing the behaviour of students, Dan arrived at the conclusion that we are not really great at setting deadlines for ourselves, and having external deadlines forced upon us might actually be a boost for the productivity of a majority of us. Details on the experiment and results can be found in the following paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;irrational-ownership&quot;&gt;Irrational Ownership&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to assigning values to objects we behave irrationally for our own possessions. Dan proved this through a series of experiments on university football tickets at the Duke University. Students who were able to purchase the tickets valued them 10 times more than students who did not get them. 10 times. This is a practical demonstration of the Endowment Effect. Dan attributes this irrationally skewed valuation to the following points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We prioritise reducing losses over gains, hence assigning greater important to our own possessions makes for an attempt to maintain the status quo which may have evolutionary benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We initiate non-monetary connections to things we own, which makes their disposition complicated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We assume people will see transactions from our own point of view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;great-expectations&quot;&gt;Great Expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our expectations play a much more important role in shaping our experiences than we realise. We tend to form stereotypes around our expectations and these stereotypes weigh strongly on our actual experience. Dan tested this through his students’ perception of taste for two brands of beers - Budweiser and a Blasmic Vinegar brew that’s native to MIT. When made aware of the beer brands, most students preferred the Budweiser as the Vinegar brew has a bad name amongst the general student community, but when unaware of the brands, students reported similar tastes and likableness for both the beer brands. The expectation of a sour vinegar-like taste from MIT brew played a crucial role in playing down its likableness. This experiment can have far-reaching repercussions in our daily lives and the decisions we make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;power-of-price&quot;&gt;Power of Price&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expensive phones are better than cheaper phones, and the same holds for watches, TVs, laptops and a lot of other stuff, right? Maybe, for a large number of cases, yes. But this has led to our brain conditioning us to believe that expensive commodities always have an edge over their cheaper alternative, so much so that we react differently to even medication that’s expensive. Placebo is an age-old concept but its application in medical prices was discovered by Dan in a series of innovative experimentation where people reported significantly greater relief from headache when they were provided an expensive headache pill compared to a cheaper alternative. There is only one catch - here, both the medicines were exactly the same. People’s expectation from the expensive medicine to be more effective was a strong enough placebo to help them with their headache. Similar concepts can be applicable in multiple spheres of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I found Predictably Irrational frankly brilliant. Dan doesn’t try to speak from an academic high-point the the book never feels preachy. Innovative new theories are presented in a very intuitive manner that readers will enjoy. As perfectly put by the New York Times, &lt;em&gt;“Predictably Irrational is a far more revolutionary book than its unthreatening manner lets on. It’s a concise summary of why today’s social science increasingly treats the markets-know-best model as a fairy tale.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Feminism is not about that moment of final triumph, but about the gradual transformation of the social field so decisively that old markers shift forever. . . It comes slowly, slowly, feminism does. But it just keeps on coming.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started reading Nivedita Menon’s ‘Seeing Like a Feminist’, I had a clear cut preconceived notion of what feminism is and what it means to be a feminist. Afterall, I constantly identified myself as one. That was the core reason behind my decision to pursue Gender Studies as a course in the first place. I held this belief that I was brought up in a modern liberal family, where there were no undue restrictions on female members and my sister and me were equal in all respects. When I heard, or read about gender bias, discrimination against women, social bias among other issues, I looked outside my family, my school and the immediate society for examples, never within. In my mind, my family, my school, my friends and my immediate society were an epitome of idealised existence where gender equality was an obvious assumption, not a right to fight for. Nivedita Menon questioned many of the fundamental beliefs I held in this direction. Many subtleties that I overlooked, and social norms that I accepted without questions were brought to light in a manner where I realised that their obviousness was a patriarchal construct in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author starts presenting her points with a quick look at nude makeup. She draws strong social parallel to how nude makeup is essentially a bunch of techniques to make a person appear more ‘naturalistic’, over and above his or her own natural self. The analogy here, is that our social order follows similar rituals, where we reiterate and naturalize certain patriarcal actions with the eventual aim of them appearing instinctive and unrehearsed, while in all fairness we are really just solidifying the opressants of feminism in our social structure. The analogy caught my attention, and was a precursor to the eye-opening nature of the book where we look at our own surroundings in an ever so slightly altered manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quotation to support argument:
&lt;em&gt;“The whole point of nude make-up, clearly, is to spend hours painting your face in order to make it look like you had not touched it at all. The maintaining of social order is rather like that. It requires the faithful performance of prescribed rituals over and over again throughout one’s lifetime. Complex networks of cultural reproduction are dedicated to this sole purpose. But the ultimate goal of all this unceasing activity is to produce the effect of untouched naturalness.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nivedita Menon goes on to look in detail at six core concepts, namely Family, Body, Desire, Sexual Violence, Feminists in today’s world and Victims. On each of these, she dwells into the grasp of patriarchy and its effect on women, subtle in some cases, violent in others - but unequivocally demeaning. I was particularly fascinated by the author’s look at our families. In her typical logical unravelling of the characteristic Indian family, she points out through careful examples how violently our families are actually bound together in its social order. I’d be honest, her statement made me reflect on my own family background, and I was left wondering for explanations at some of her points. The ever-present marriage pressure, for example, something that has been notoriously naturalised by Indian pop-culture, its enforcement at the hands of a rigid patriarchal society, and violent treatment of those who oppose it, left me wondering how close I actually am to system that rejects the basic human will to love a person of choice. Acceptance of homosexuality is a far cry in a system so rigid where life-long matches are made on socio-economic grounds by non-involved parties, without even the consent of the couple in many scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quotation to support argument:
&lt;em&gt;“The family is an institution that rigidly enforces systems of inheritance and descent, and in this structure, individuals – sons, daughters, wives, husbands – are resources that are strictly bound by the violence, implicit and explicit, of this frame. As feminists, we need to build up the capacity and the strength of both men and women to live in ways in which marriage is voluntary, and to build alternate non-marriage based communities.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of homosexuality, the author paints a realistic picture of the Indian society, one that the millennial generation is acutely aware of but rarely acknowledges. Despite the law being accepting of homesexuality today, a majority of the Indian demographic is unaware and uneducated on its basic notions. The usage of the term ‘queer’ probably best reflects what an overwhelming majority of the Indian diaspora feels about individuals who stray away from traditional straight marriages. The ground reality remains that fluidity of sexuality is not a concept that our present society comprehends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quotation to support argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Perhaps also, one body may, in one lifetime, move through many identities and desires. The use of ‘queer’ then, is a deliberate political move, which underscores the fluidity (potential and actual) of sexual identity and sexual desire.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Real change in society comes from the kinds of ways queer people live; women and men who don’t choose to marry, or marry and do different kinds of things with that marriage; when workers organise; domestic servants organise.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing Like A Feminist was published at a time when India was grappling from a horrific case of sexual violence, one that brought the nation to a standstill and grabbed our imagination in an unprecedented manner. Today, 7 years later, I am not certain if we’ve made any progress whatsoever. The statistics reflect that no significant change has been brought about and the sad reality remains that we live in a nation where marital rape isn’t a crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my personal opinion, the unfortunate legality of marital rape in India is the quintessential representation of the flawed patriarchal model that Nivedita Menon talks about. If we try and break it down logically, the facts are that a heinous and violent crime against an individual is judged as acceptable in India as long as it occurs within the confines of marriage, a carefully created social construct that is patriarchally biased and rigit to its very core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking beyond the book, Nivedita Menon puts forward a radical definition of feminism, where she does not identify it as movement with some arbitrary triumphant victory in mind. She looks at feminism as a gradual transformation of our social order, a decisive shift that leaves old markers behind, and I couldn’t agree more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>vivekkaushal</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Non-Fiction" /><category term="Book Report" /><summary type="html">Information Box: Book : Seeing Like A Feminist Author : Nivedita Menon DoP : 2012 Genre : Non-Fiction Tags : Feminism, Society, Indian Culture Rating : 7/10</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/seeing-like-a-feminist.png" /></entry></feed>
