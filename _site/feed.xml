&lt;p&gt;The refactoring task was undertaken as a team project for the Software Engineering course at IIIT Hyderabad. A codebase sized at 5000 locs was studied and refactored. The repository for the codebase and modifications made will be added right here as soon as the evaluations are in, till then, as per academic regulations, they remain private. The documentation of changes made and the study itself can be found below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview-of-project&quot;&gt;Overview of Project:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The designed software is focused on  automating a chain of bowling establishments owned by the Lucky Strikes Bowling Center (LSBC). The final product needs to have certain basic functionalities which are listed below this paragraph. Besides the mentioned functionality, the project has been coded in line with established industry standards in Java, with proper documentation for easy understanding of the codebase and possible future refactoring and/or extension. List of functionalities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Detection of the number of bowling pins knocked down after a bowler has bowled.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The bowling alley’s scoring station displays information corresponding to the current bowler’s score in respective bowling lanes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Addition of new bowlers and edits to existing patrons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A service to maintain history of a bowler’s score, average and relevant information is provided for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features-of-project&quot;&gt;Features of Project:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lane-management&quot;&gt;Lane Management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a bowler enters a LSBC, he checks in at the control desk for a lane assignment. Bowlers may check in as a group or party so that they will be assigned to the same lane. Each lane can accommodate one to five bowlers. The order in which a party checks in determines the order in which they will bowl. Once a party has started bowling, the control desk can monitor the number of &lt;strong&gt;frames&lt;/strong&gt; completed by each bowler. When a bowler has completed a game, the control desk is notified of the bowler’s score for that game. When the last bowler in the party has completed his game, the party may start a new game or check out at the control desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scoring-station&quot;&gt;Scoring Station&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each lane is equipped with a stand-alone scoring station that lists the bowlers’ names (in the order they checked in) and a graphic representation of their scores. A typical score sheet for one bowler looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ibb.co/kgS8R1H/Screenshot-2019-01-28-at-1-31-38-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bowlers alternate rolling the ball or taking throws according to the scoring rules of bowling referenced in the following section. The automatic pinsetter is able to detect the number of pins still standing on a lane after each throw. This information is then transmitted back to the scoring station. The scoring station also displays the pins that are still standing after each throw. More details on how to keep scores in bowling can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://slocums.homestead.com/gamescore.html&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pinsetter-interface&quot;&gt;Pinsetter Interface&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pinsetter interface communicates to the scoring station the pins that are left standing after a bowler has completed a throw. A throw is complete when the bowling ball hits the end of the alley beyond the last row of pins. The pinsetter will re-rack the pins (places all ten down) after two consecutive throws have been detected. The pinsetter interface also accepts a command that will be treated in the same manner as a thrown ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bowler-management&quot;&gt;Bowler Management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A history of all bowler’s scores and their current average per game is maintained for patrons. Bowlers perform a one-time registration the first time they check in at the control desk by providing their full name and an email address. They also provide a preferred nickname to be displayed on the scoring station when they are bowling. When a bowler has checked out at the control desk after completing his/her games, a report is generated containing the bowler’s scores from games just completed, previous scores and his/her current average. This report is automatically emailed to the bowler with the option of a printout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;additional-control-desk-functions&quot;&gt;Additional Control Desk Functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The control desk operator has the ability to monitor the scores of any active lane. A configurable display option will allow the operator to view the score of an individual scoring station or multiple scoring stations. In the event a lane has a mechanical problem – ball not returned, pinsetter did not re-rack, etc.– the bowler may contact the control desk through an interface on the scoring station. The control station sends an acknowledgement of the request back to the scoring station.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Alley&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;The Alley class is a container for the bowling simulator.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Bowler&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;The Bowler class holds information about the bowlers.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;ControlDesk&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;The Control Desk class manages all functionalities of the control desk in the bowling alley simulation.  It keeps tabs on availability of subscribers, queues,  lanes and also assigns lanes to bowlers. The Control  Desk also prints score.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Drive&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;The Drive class is the primary entry point for the program and it calls the ControlDesk and Alley classes.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;EndGameReport&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;The EndGameReport class creates the final score reports in a proper pre-defined format.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Lane&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;The Lane class handles the lane end of the bowling alley simulation. It keeps a tab on games and bowling frames,  while also displaying scores that are sent to it.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Pinsetter&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;The Pinsetter class represents the Pinsetter in the bowling simulation. It senses the number of pins knocked down by a  thrown ball and also simulates the throw of the bowling ball.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;AddPartyView&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Defines functions like Add Party, add party panel, setting layout and border of the bowling alley, etc. Adds the list of bowlers (team wise and individually) to be a list to make them play one after the other. Sets the functionalities of buttons and adds listeners to them.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;ControlDeskView&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;The ControlDeskView class shows the score and pinsetter details  for each player/team that is currently playing in the alley.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strengths-of-the-original-codebase&quot;&gt;Strengths of the Original Codebase:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-usage-of-object-oriented-design-patterns&quot;&gt;1. Usage of Object Oriented Design patterns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The codebase is built in an object oriented design with the usage of proper Object Oriented Design patterns. Programming structures of object oriented concepts are deftly applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inheritance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Lane&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PinsetterObserver&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), retaining similar implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encapsulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fullName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nickName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. Technically in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class is hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of own class in which they are declared. As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it is also known as data-hiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstraction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ControlDesk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;controlDesk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only the relevant details to the object. It helps to reduce programming complexity and effort. In Java, abstraction is accomplished using Abstract classes and interfaces. As in here, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;controlDesk&lt;/code&gt; is an abstract object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-less-within-class-code-smells&quot;&gt;2. Less Within-Class Code Smells&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very few code smells that are related to variable names and comments. Thus we can say that the code is easy to understand and intuitive in that sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-use-of-standard-object-oriented-patterns&quot;&gt;3. Use of Standard Object Oriented Patterns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widely accepted Object Oriented patterns have been used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;LaneEventInterface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rmi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Remote&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getFrameNum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rmi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;RemoteException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HashMap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getScore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rmi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;RemoteException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getCurScores&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rmi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;RemoteException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-the-blob-kitchen-sink&quot;&gt;1. The Blob &lt;em&gt;(Kitchen Sink)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ibb.co/JyjPmt5/Screenshot-2019-02-11-at-5-08-44-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lane Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Lane&lt;/code&gt; class is the perfect example of a &lt;strong&gt;kitchen sink&lt;/strong&gt; class, or a &lt;strong&gt;Blob.&lt;/strong&gt; The Blob is found in designs where one class monopolizes the processing, and other classes primarily encapsulate data. This AntiPattern is characterized by a class diagram composed of a single complex controller class surrounded by simple data classes. The key problem here is that the majority of the responsibilities are allocated to a single class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Blob contains the majority of the process, and the other objects contain the data. Architectures with the Blob have separated process from data; in other words, they are procedural-style rather than object-oriented architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-the-middleman-class&quot;&gt;2. The MiddleMan class&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ibb.co/T2c7r87/middleman.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MiddleMan in UML&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Alley&lt;/code&gt; is the perfect example of a middleman class. The primary logic behind this code smell is the idea that if a class is delegating all its work, why does it exist? We can cut out the middleman. Classes like these are merely wrappers over other classes or existing functionality in the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ball&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;	
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mechProb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mechProblem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original codebase contains multiple methods with long parameter lists. It’s hard to understand such lists, which become contradictory and hard to use as they grow longer. Instead of a long list of parameters, a method can use the data of its own object. If the current object doesn’t contain all necessary data, another object (which will get the necessary data) can be passed as a method parameter. Here, the method &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LaneEvent()&lt;/code&gt; is highlighted with it’s extremely long parameter list.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Vector&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bowlerdb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ControlDeskView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;controlDesk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;selectedNick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;selectedMember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original codebase has a significantly high number of Attributes per Class, with a high of &lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt; in the class &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AddPartyView&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-workflow&quot;&gt;Our Workflow:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-understanding-the-codebase&quot;&gt;1. Understanding the Codebase&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went through the codebase in detail with careful emphasis on understanding the implementation. Focus was laid on analyzing different classes, interpreters and included methods to better understand the functioning of the codebase and understand the flow of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-drawing-uml-representation-of-the-codebase&quot;&gt;2. Drawing UML Representation of the Codebase&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon getting comfortable with the codebase we proceeded to draw a UML Class diagram representing the structure of the codebase along with a sequence diagram to show the flow of control in the codebase. This helped clarify our own understanding as well as brought implementation defects and code-smells to light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-identifying-stakeholders&quot;&gt;3. Identifying Stakeholders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used the UML Sequence Diagram to work upon our understanding of the various stakeholders in the Bowling Alley Management System. Identifying stakeholders enabled us to look at the flow of control from different perspectives, including user-end views, which brought implementation and code-smells improvements to light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-understanding-features&quot;&gt;4. Understanding Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used the UML Class Diagram to understand the various functionalities of the codebase. Isolating each functionality and understanding its flow of control played an important role in understanding multiple feature-related code-smells and defects in implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-identify-code-smells&quot;&gt;5. Identify Code Smells&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our understanding of the project gained through an in-depth reading of the codebase and study of UML Class and Sequence diagrams we isolated code smells in the project that we believed could be fixed iteratively with constant testing. Following sections of this document lay greater emphasis on the categories of code-smells identified and our counter-strategy for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-fixing-and-logging-the-code-smells&quot;&gt;6. Fixing and Logging the Code Smells&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post isolation, we went ahead and fixed the code-smells using strategies highlighted in later sections. During the entire iterative refactoring process we tested the codebase for functionality at each stage. Each code-smell was logged upon being worked upon and the work was documented thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-our-design-is-an-improvement-and-code-smells-solved&quot;&gt;How Our Design is an Improvement and Code Smells Solved:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-high-cohesion&quot;&gt;1. High Cohesion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together. It is a measure of the strength of relationship between the methods and data of a class and some unifying purpose or concept served by that class. In another sense, it is a measure of the strength of relationship between the class’s methods and data themselves. Modules with high cohesion tend to be preferable, because high cohesion is associated with several desirable traits of software including robustness, reliability, reusability, and understandability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in the refactored codebase, the originally &lt;strong&gt;Blob Class&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Lane&lt;/code&gt; has been simplified to make it more cohesive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Lane&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PinsetterObserver&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;	
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Pinsetter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;setter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HashMap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;scores&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ball&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bowlIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;frameNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;curScores&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[][]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;finalScores&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gameNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Bowler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;currentThrower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;			
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-lazy-middleman-class-removed&quot;&gt;2. Lazy MiddleMan Class Removed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classes that largely delegate a majority, or in cases, all of their functionality to other classes, or rely on calling methods from other classes for their functioning and lack any useful methods or their own are classified as a lazy class. For example, in our codebase, the class &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Alley&lt;/code&gt; was a lazy class, which was merely delegating it’s functionality to other classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Alley&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ControlDesk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;controldesk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Alley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;numLanes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;controldesk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ControlDesk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;numLanes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ControlDesk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getControlDesk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;controldesk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Alley&lt;/code&gt; seemed integral to the project, but upon closer investigation it turned out to be middleman calling other class’ methods. Hence, the class was eliminated and it’s functionality re-distributed. In-line with the characteristics of &lt;strong&gt;Poltergeist Anti-Pattern&lt;/strong&gt;, the management of functionality and complexity of the code was increasing. This issue was deftly dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-cyclomatic-complexity-reduced&quot;&gt;3. Cyclomatic Complexity Reduced&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cyclomatic complexity of a method is calculated by developing a Control Flow Graph of the code that measures the number of linearly-independent paths through a program module. We have set the limit for cyclomatic complexity to 12. Hence we reduced the complexities of methods and classed to less than 12. Cyclomatic complexity found:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getScore()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;38&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;run()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;19&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;addPartyView()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created two new methods i.e. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gameNotFinished()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;runLaneMethod()&lt;/code&gt; that are independent of each other and will be called inside the run function at the time of execution. This reduces the cyclomatic complexity of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getScore()&lt;/code&gt; to 9. Similarly, a new method named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;frameNumber9()&lt;/code&gt; which handles conditions that don’t allow users another throw and handles the case of 10th frame first was created to reduce the cyclomatic complexity of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;run()&lt;/code&gt; to 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new method named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;laneEventBowlers()&lt;/code&gt; was created that handles the lane events for Bowlers and hence reduced the cyclomatic complexity to of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;receiveLaneEvent()&lt;/code&gt; to 11. Similarly, the method &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;partyContentCheck()&lt;/code&gt; handles the checking of whether a player belongs to a party and reduces the cyclomatic complexity of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;addPartyView()&lt;/code&gt; to 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-long-methods-reduced-in-size-without-loss-in-functionality&quot;&gt;4. Long Methods reduced in size without loss in functionality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shorter methods are easier to extend, easier to understand and easier to maintain, hence long methods in the existing codebase were identified as code-smells and acted upon. Methods were simplified by splitting independent parts of code into new methods. A trade-off here is that the total number of methods increased. Methods which violate the rule are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Previous Line Count&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;New Line Count&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getScore&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;135&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;92&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;32&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;addPartyView&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;132&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;90&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-long-parameter-list-restrained&quot;&gt;5. Long Parameter List Restrained&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more parameters a method has, the more complex it is. Hence, maximum number of parameters are set to 7.
Classes which violate the rule were modified to reduce the number of required parameters. For example, in&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LaneEvent&lt;/code&gt; integral parameters were grouped together into a single &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/code&gt; of adequate dimensions. Classes which were corrected are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Class&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Previous Parameter Count&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;New Parameter Count&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LaneEvent&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-removing-dead-code&quot;&gt;6. Removing Dead Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead code is a section in the source code of a program which is executed but whose result is never used in any other computation. The execution of dead code wastes computation time and memory. We found dead code in the following classes and simply deleted those lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getScore()&lt;/code&gt; 
 Several lines of dead code were deleted which were commented out and were not serving any purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-nested-block-depth&quot;&gt;7. Nested Block Depth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nested block depth is defined as the depth of the nested block of code. Greater depth makes the understanding, extension and refactoring of code complicated. Hence, its desirable to reduce the nested block depth. We worked on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getScore()&lt;/code&gt; method and reduced its effective nested block depth significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-lack-of-descriptive-comments&quot;&gt;8. Lack of Descriptive Comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project contains a skeletal amount of documentation, with bare-minimum descriptive comments for certain classes. Hence, documentation was added for the following classes to make the code more readable, extensible and understandable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ScoreReport&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ScoreHistoryFile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Score&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Queue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-uncommunicative-names&quot;&gt;9. Uncommunicative Names&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncommunicative or unintuitive class names make it extremely hard to understand and extend a codebase. The general rule of thumb is that if the name of the method succinctly describes what that method does then it’s an acceptable name. Else, there is an urgent need to rewrite it. The classes and methods we renamed are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Old Name&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;New Name&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;NewPatternView&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;AddPatternView&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;assignParty()&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;startParty()&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Sure, there were some lows, but the highs outweighed them as the startups made some big moves. Whether it be cutting-edge developments in Artificial Intelligence and IoT, or bureaucratic and industrial standards for data privacy and security, 2018 had it all. Plenty of technologies that were primarily 'buzzwords' in 2017, matured in 2018, with greater stability and broader appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2018 was a tremendous year for the entrepreneurial community in the Indian ecosystem as well, where a final boost was observed for funding in late-stage ventures (Eg: Berkshire Hathaway's stake in PayTM). The shifting pattern of funding clearly illustrated a move towards India becoming a more mature market. Another noteworthy point was the slowdown in early-stage venture funding, which is in line with our earlier observations and the recent move on the Angel Tax is something to dwell upon. Despite the minute hiccups, deep-tech startups continued to raise eyebrows and attract capital even in early stage and initial seed rounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Indian e-commerce market heating up, two of the world's largest brands in e-commerce - Amazon and Walmart have made India their battlefield in 2018. Amazon India was valued at USD 16 billion by CITI Research in 2018, while Flipkart, the homegrown unicorn and most significant player in the Indian e-commerce section was annexed by Walmart in a deal where a controlling 77% stake was acquired in the local seller for USD 16 billion. As per latest figures, both Amazon India and Walmart-owned Flipkart are poised equally with 30% market share a-piece, and the coming few years can be crucial as these behemoths battle out for market dominance in a war on prices, where the consumer is a sure-shot winner. Zomato has long maintained a foreign presence, though 2018 saw Zomato expand to a total of 24 countries. Wittyfeed, an Indore based viral media startup also established itself offshores with a presence in North America, UK, Australia, Argentina amongst others, while Practo made strides into the Brazilian, Indonesian, Philippine and Singaporean market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2018 also saw many Indian startups look out of the local markets for potential customers. These include the hotel-aggregator OYO Rooms which recently expanded its services from Nepal and Malaysia to contain China. The current model is looking to cash upon Indian tourists that visit China, but the company has larger dreams for the market. Ola Cabs also expanded globally in January 2018 when it entered the crowded Australian market, by year-end Ola has a sizable presence in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following sections, we'll take a closer look at the most happening technologies of the year 2018, and elaborate upon the possible trends of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;artificial-intelligence-spreading-its-wings&quot;&gt;Artificial Intelligence Spreading Its Wings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence took almost every sector by storm in 2018, and if we attempt to break down the causes for AI's meteoric rise, it comes down to rapid advancements in machine learning algorithms and the development GPUs that are pushing computational boundaries and making faster and cheaper processing available to developers and users alike. The rate of advancement has beaten all expectations and has, quite frankly, been phenomenal. Experts had predicted that the artificial agents will beat humans in the 'Go' game by 2027, though it ended up doing that in 2017 itself, an entire decade earlier than anticipated. In an experiment in self-monitored learning, Google's AlphaGo trained for 40 days and ended up becoming the best Go player in our history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2018 witnessed further creation of developed, self-taught artificial intelligence with breakthroughs in decision-making, data analysis, recognition of objects, emotions, scientific models natural language processing among others. Besides performance improvements, the accessibility of technology was also made better, faster, and cheaper for users. Though with developments, concerns have also been raised throughout 2018 about the potential threat of advanced Artificial Intelligence by some of the most visionary leaders of the technology world, including late Dr Stephen Hawking, tech mogul Elon Musk among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/2018_review_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stats-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in recent times Google Brain developed algorithms based on self-learning and created new encryption methodologies which were unlike any seen before. This was done with an aim to protect data from other neural networks. In a similar incident, Facebook had to shut down two artificial agents that created their own secret language, without any instructions or human intervention,  and used complex strategies to communicate. One thing that appears is that Artificial Intelligence is going to be fundamentally different from Human Intelligence and careful research is necessary to understand the societal impacts of the technology at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-maturing-blockchain-in-2018&quot;&gt;A Maturing Blockchain in 2018&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain was still a relatively nascent technology when it grabbed headlines in 2017 owing to the unprecedented media coverage over the price bubble that formed around Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that are based on blockchain technology. Bitcoin reached an all-time high exchange rate of USD 19,783.06 in late 2017, and the resulting public frenzy grabbing a lot of eyeballs. All this brought blockchain to the limelight, and 2018 witnessed the testing and gradual adaptation of blockchain in various different domains, from medical records to mainstream financial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential applications of blockchain include supply chain management, real estate listings, robust financial services, better tracking of patient records in the healthcare system among others. Despite its promises, blockchain has its fair share of setbacks with huge computational and architectural requirements which have held back market leaders from adopting blockchain on a broader scale. This also witnessed pilot studies and research into application and adoption of the technology. The technology was also a favourite for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists with over USD 3.9 billion being invested in Blockchain throughout 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vis-a-vis-with-the-dark-side-of-the-information-age&quot;&gt;Vis-a-vis with the Dark Side of the Information Age&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2018 was also a year of self-introspection for the internet, and the technology industry at large. Major technology companies that have a business model where user-data is used for commercial purposes (like selling targeted ads) were put too close scrutiny by some different nations. The founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg had to appear for a widely publicised congressional hearing in early April of this year for the alleged abuse of user data by analytics firm Cambridge Analytica for campaigning in the US presidential elections. Search engine giant Google was similarly scrutinised in Europe for its violation of market dominance in the mobile software segment and penalised billions of dollars. The revelation brought user privacy concerns to the forefront, and 2018 witnessed hotly contested debates on the subject in public and private forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different sovereign states passed resolutions to govern user data privacy, most notably the European Union adopted the GDPR - (General Data Protection Regulation) which raised the standard of data privacy in Europe and catalysed similar resolutions in other countries and regions as well. All in all, with the ubiquitous nature of technology today, and the obsession of technology giants with data collection, utilisation and eventual monetisation, 2018 was a mature step in the right direction that brought data privacy concerns to the streets. Hopefully, we head into a safer world in 2019 where privacy is a fundamental right like any other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rejuvenated-fintech-sector&quot;&gt;Rejuvenated Fintech Sector&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2018 was an excellent year for the Indian Fintech industry with startups of the likes of Paytm receiving funding from Wall Street legend Warren Buffett's investment firm Berkshire Hathaway. A cumulative of USD 2 billion was raised by Indian financial startups in 2018, with Sequoia Capital and Action Ventures emerging as the lead investors. Policy Bazaar, Pine Labs and Phone Pe were among some of the recipients of the funding boost in fintech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovations centred around mobile payment, proximity-based payment systems, insurance tech, crowdfunding and banking technology. Several payment applications based on the government of India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) continued strong growth for the sector in 2018, maintaining sustainable growth figures in the post-demonetisation era. This was further propelled by the launch of UPI 2.0 in August 2018 with the integration of new features like IPO subscription, block features on digital payment and overdraft facility. The government has also revamped its guidelines for active agents in Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs). The new guidelines provide for interoperability of mobile wallets (not mandated), EMV chip and PIN compliant cards among others. The modifications aim to transform the fintech landscape of India, making it more transparent and end-user-friendly, while Fintech startups face the imminent need to modify their business models accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2018, the Supreme Court passed a landmark judgement on the validity and usage guidelines for Aadhar and associated biometric data. In line with government guidelines, Fintech startups that operate in lending and e-wallet businesses require KYC (know your customer) authentication of users. This was done using end-users Aadhar data, but the new guidelines dictate that other forms of authentication need to be looked at, while Aadhar-based authentication will now require the consent of end users, with data storage period cut-down to 6 months from an earlier 5 years as well. The changes pose logistic and legal hurdles for fintech startups, and they'll have to rework their business models which were earlier built around  Aadhar authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamic nature of the modern-day banking system with ever-increasing sophistication poses significant hurdles for fintech startups that need to ensure legal compliance and logistic viability. This dilemma has paved the way for Regulatory Sandboxes in the fintech space. A Regulatory Sandbox is essentially a virtual environment where testers and drivers of innovation can run products in real-time and add appropriate safeguards to ensure regulatory compliance. This emerging model of pilot testing allows for more stable public releases and better end-user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally as well, mobile payments have fundamentally changed the financial markets. Chinese mobile payment volumes presently exceed USD 5 trillion per annum in transfers. 2018, also looked at biometrics like fingerprints, facial recognition and voice identification to make purchases faster and checking out from shops smoother. Financial market watchers now believe that banking institutions may earn in the vicinity of USD 1 billion per year from blockchain-based cryptocurrencies by 2020. A noteworthy point here is the meteoric rise of Stable Coins, crypto-based currencies that are pegged to other currencies, other cryptocurrencies or prices of commodities. Unlike cryptocurrencies, stable coins are not as volatile with their price relatively stable, hence being a more attractive investment destination for potential investors after the fall of cryptocurrencies in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the European Union adopted a revised version of the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) with an aim to level the European banking ecosystem and make banking smoother for consumers. The issued directives included consent-based sharing of financial institution data of consumers with third parties, (e.g. Fintech based startups) which would open up a broad avenue for startups in the domain to grow and capitalise upon. This also eliminates the possibility of a monopoly by large banking institutions. We might just be on the verge of a revolution in the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-sneak-peak-in-the--health-tech-space&quot;&gt;A Sneak Peak in the  Health-Tech Space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over USD 510 million was invested in Indian health-tech startups in 2018, a record-high for investments in the sector. Startups like Pharma Easy and CureFit raised funds in the vicinity of USD 115 million and USD 100 million respectively. Another Bangalore based startup SigTuple, which takes an AI-driven approach to healthcare, raised USD 19 million in a significant boost to deep tech startups in healthcare. Around 80 health-tech startups successfully raised funds in 2018 as per data from Tracxn Technologies. The sector has seen boosted investor optimism, with various contributing factors, including institutional support, government schemes and global cues. The government's launch of the Ayushman Bharat Yojna - (PMJAY) further boosted morale in the industry and provided much-needed insurance cover and awareness to all rungs of the society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking beyond India, globally as well, 2018 has been a record-setting year for  HealthTech. With half-yearly reports listing USD 10.6 billion as VC investment in the sectors, year-end projections estimated that 2018 could very well have been the best one yet for the health tech industry with money pouring in from various sources, both public and private. The optimism about the sector was also boosted by an unprecedented BioTech boom at Wall Street. Several companies of the industry had successful IPOs, with over USD 460 million being raked in by 8 biotech startups in June alone. Revolutionary new products and diagnostic tools also boosted consumer and investor interest in the sector, for example, the introduction of ECG integrated Apple Watch has been much talked about, with the company emerging as an unrivalled market leader in the segment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2019-trends&quot;&gt;2019 Trends&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/2018_review_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stats-4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fig : A surge in late stage funding - &lt;em&gt;Source: Tracxn Technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While 2018 was definitely a happening year for technology, 2019 is knocking at our doors with its own promises. Besides strides in the development of new groundbreaking technology, 2019 will also be about innovative applications of existing tech. Whether it be an integration of Artificial Intelligence with IoT or the organisation of our interactions with the technology itself. A growing sentiment has also been observed for B2B business models in the global market, and India is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the diversion of high portions of VC funding to deep-tech based ventures, scalability has emerged as the most prominent bottleneck for the growth of such startups. Hence, a large number of such investments are opting for a B2B model, which has seen tremendous growth in the Indian market, owing to a lack of businesses catering to business needs. Reports from various sources confirm this trend, with a TechinAsia illustrating the rising share of B2B startups, from 34% in 2016 to 47% in 2017 and then above the 50% mark in 2018, regarding new startups registered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-imminent-indian-edtech-book&quot;&gt;An Imminent Indian EdTech Book&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A noteworthy point has been the lack of large-scale edtech ventures in the Indian ecosystem, contrary to the global optimism in the sector where investment has reached over USD 6 billion. Though there are breakout startups in the industry, most notably Embibe and Byju's, with the latter being touted as one of the most noticeable startups to come out of the Indian ecosystem in the last 5 years, having already attracted investments of USD 880 million at a valuation of USD 3.6 billion. Embibe also recently raised USD 180 million from Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), marking the behemoth's mark into Indian edtech. Going forward into 2019, edtech India could see more optimism regarding funding and ventures, as more players attempt to gain market share in one of the world's most lucrative education markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;further-developments-in-ai-and-iot&quot;&gt;Further Developments in AI and IoT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019 will start a significant shift in the tools that are available for using AI. Infrastructure, framework and platform tools used to implement AI would start focussing on technologists and the developer community rather than focussing on data scientists. With this expansion of accessibility, developers would be able to directly integrate AI-based solutions into their applications without external assistance. Presently, we are using 1% of data generated by us efficiently. Experts believe that the number could go up to 3-4% by the end of 2020, which is a huge increase considering that 90% of all the world's data was generated last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, there are plenty of companies like Microsoft, SAP, SAS and Salesforce which are displaying leadership in the promotion of data-based solutions and their application into meaningful business analytics. There is undoubtedly still a lot to be achieved by data-driven organisations to fully realise the power of data they are collecting and their optimal usage, developments in 2019 will hopefully be a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;immersive-technologies&quot;&gt;Immersive Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) have been around for quite some time now, although their applications have primarily been restricted. In simple terms, systems which combine real-time vision, sound, haptics and possibly even other senses, enable people to fully immerse themselves in real-time simulations. Immersive technologies are now actively being applied across a broad spectrum of industries, ranging from art and entertainment to commerce, education, medical rehabilitation and the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, VirtualShip is a simulation software which is used in the US Navy to train recruits. Applications include training pilots, doctors, teachers, security personnel etc., and with the launch of Apple AR Kit, as well as steps were taken by Google (Launch of Google Playground) and Facebook to integrate AR and VR in their mobile platform and application respectively, our smartphones might very well be AR integrated by year-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research by Monster.com revealed that opportunities for job-seekers with experience in immersive technologies are up by 37%, while there is an acute shortage in supply. Estimates state that by 2022, over 70% of enterprises would have conducted experiments with AR/VR technologies and over 25% of them would have deployed these to production. 2019 certainly holds promise in this domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;automation&quot;&gt;Automation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019 would bring with itself a wave of automation, in manufacturing, machine learning algorithms and even on our roads. Robots in manufacturing are nothing new, they have been around since the 1960s. In the modern world, significant development is the scale of automation and the resulting transformation it can bring to a wide range of industries. Automation is not limited to factories today, presently, services such as the legal and finance consultancy are facing disruptions by automation, and there is an immense potential for the technology to scale. McKinsey reported that over 60% of all occupations can be partially automated, with 5% being fully automatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019 is also being touted as the year of self-driving cars. Waymo, the Google-owned subsidiary which is credited for being the technological leader in automated vehicles, already has over 10 million miles of actual road experience and over a billion miles of simulation training. Waymo is planning on launching a commercial version of it's Phoenix, Arizona test program at in multiple cities early towards 2019. If Waymo succeeds in meeting its deadlines, the Google-owned subsidiary will have the largest fleet of self-driving cars in operation next year. General Motor, Tesla and Uber are all building rival technologies, but one fact that is crystal clear is that automation will be a crucial focus of technological change, with potentially far-reaching economic and social consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;edge-computing&quot;&gt;Edge Computing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern IoT systems require fast server response times. Edge computing is an architectural topology wherein data processing, content collection and delivery are handled close to the sources of data, with the underlying assumption that keeping traffic local reduces latency. Edge Computing addresses challenges like high WAN costs and unacceptable levels of latency. 2019 will see a boost in Edge Computing topologies with IoT set to become a significant driver for growth in a cross-industry spectrum. Estimates state that by 2022, the global edge computing market is will reach USD 6.72 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per reports from Gartner, a leading research and advisory firm, there are expectations for a sustained increase in the embedding of the sensor, storage, computation and AI engine in edge devices by 2028. The general notion states that the industry will proceed towards the edge of computation in a variety of endpoint devices, whether large or small, personal or enterprise. This would significantly improve the performance of IoT based devices and traditional networking infrastructure alike by minimising latency in response time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5g-and-content-delivery&quot;&gt;5G and Content Delivery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the launch of 4G - LTE (Long Term Evolution) at Oslo in late 2009, the high-speed mobile broadband technology has revolutionised data consumption all over the world. Possibly, the most dramatic of these results have been seen in India, where the December 2015 launch of Jio brought with itself a telecommunication revolution took the country by storm and increased data consumption by 15 times in 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a direct impact of this immense increase in consumption, India has emerged as an extremely lucrative high growth market to video content and entertainment ventures like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Although presently, Hotstart holds an overwhelming majority in the Indian market with a market share of 70%, both Netflix and Amazon Prime are fringe competitors, lagging behind the likes of SonyLIV and Voot. Though this may change in the immediate future with Netflix joining hands with Tata Sky, one of India's largest DTH providers for content delivery on Tata Sky's platform. Following is a quantification of Indian streaming market's potential growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/2018_review_6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stats-6&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019 brings with itself another revolution - 5G telecommunication. A consortium of companies like Qualcomm, Intel, Nokia, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei have already started testing for deployment. 2018 has been the year when groundwork has been laid for 5G rollout in several developed markets, while it is in 2019 only, that we are going to actually see 5G being launched and made commercially available. Though it might still be at least a couple of years before the service is made available to consumers in the Indian market. While Apple users will have to wait till 2020 too, with the company stating that it won't be making 5G devices in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in exciting times, a world where each new day brings with it the optimism for a better tomorrow, and we have, in large parts, technology to thank for this positive outlook. With revolutions in Data, AI, Automation, Immersive Tech and other core areas knocking at our doors, only time will tell the real significance of our current innovations and modern advancements.&lt;/p&gt;

Sure, there were some lows, but the highs outweighed them as the startups made some big moves. Whether it be cutting-edge developments in Artificial Intelligence and IoT, or bureaucratic and industrial standards for data privacy and security, 2018 had it all. Plenty of technologies that were primarily 'buzzwords' in 2017, matured in 2018, with greater stability and broader appeal.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/2018.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">IIIT Courier Notification System</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/IIIT-Courier/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="IIIT Courier Notification System" /><published>2018-12-14T07:32:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-12-14T07:32:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/IIIT-Courier</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/IIIT-Courier/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3-green.svg&quot; alt=&quot;python&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IIIT Hyderabad has a central location where all letters and parcels addressed to residents are stored. There is an intranet portal where one can check for any new parcels addressed to one. The problem is that, it seems trivially easy to setup a parallel mailing system, such that upon delivery of a letter/courier one would get an instant notification on the official institute ID. Unfortunately, nothing of sorts has been deployed yet. This script is a fix for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This script is a cron job and has been written with an intention to notify you via email whenever you get a new parcel, courier, letter etc. at IIIT Hyderabad, and your delivery is logged at Nilgiri. Read up ahead for usage instructions and setup.&lt;/p&gt;

With an immense market potential, it's not a surprise that an unproportionally large number of Indian startups are in the e-commerce sphere. Though a much more dismal fact is that a significant proportion of these startups shut shop within the first few years of starting out. Common reasons cited for these failures include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;competition&quot;&gt;Competition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Established e-commerce players with higher funding can often offer steep discounts that cut into the revenue of new companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scalability&quot;&gt;Scalability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scaling an ecommerce venture beyond metropolis cities is a challenge for major players in the field and new and upcoming startups alike. The crowded market space in metros makes sustaining an ecommerce business on tier one city sales alone a major challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;funding-crunch&quot;&gt;Funding Crunch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The e-commerce space has been hit by a crunch in venture capital and other sources of funding that have been largely redirected to other up and coming tech in the promising fields of blockchain, cryptocurrency, medtech and agritech. A simple website and a marketplace are no longer promising ventures for investment in the modern economy. Investments in e-commerce are not focussed on late stage startups and comparatively established players who are looking at reaping benefits and turning profitable in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article &lt;strong&gt;we address scalability issues of an ecommerce venture&lt;/strong&gt; , more particularly in hyperlocal communities that have largely been out of focus and out of reach for even major ecommerce players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-you-scale-to-hyperlocal-communities&quot;&gt;Why should you scale to hyperlocal communities?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all fairness, it has been a decade since ecommerce took off in India with the popular rise of Flipkart and the entry of global players such as Amazon and Ebay. A decade ago, the primary targets for any new ecommerce venture were Indian metropolis, tier one cities with huge populations and a higher disposable income than the national average. Though now, with the Indian ecommerce sector maturing, growth has slowed down in tier one cities. While as per a 2018 report in MoneyControl, ecommerce revenue growth is thrice as much in tier two cities. Expanding to tier two and tier three cities is essentially to tap the growing ecommerce user base in these cities. A few points to summarise the opportunities available in the hyperlocal ecommerce space in India are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;increasing-internet-penetration&quot;&gt;Increasing Internet Penetration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley expects the online Indian customer base to increase form 60 million in 2016 to 475 million by 2026. While urban regions already have an internet penetration of 64.8% as of December 2017, the penetration is dismally low at 18% in rural India. Hence the projection model of Morgan Stanley implies that a major chunk of new user growth is going to come from rural regions in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;infrastructural-improvements&quot;&gt;Infrastructural Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch of 4G network in India has brought about a telecommunication revolution, with the cheapest data rates in the world and a bidding war to earn new customers. It has also made mobile broadband available to the general India diaspora ast affordable prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limited-local-options&quot;&gt;Limited Local Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike tier one cities, tier two and tier three localities do not have plentiful brick and mortar options to cater to all of their needs, which opens up immense potential for ecommerce based solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;online-to-offline-models&quot;&gt;Online to Offline Models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service, delivery and logistics issues in rural regions have opened avenues for ecommerce startups that use brick and mortar stores as fronts for online sales. &lt;strong&gt;Indiabuys&lt;/strong&gt; is an assisted startup launched in 2017 with support from Amazon that aims to bridge the availability and delivery divide between rural and urban regions through its 'phygital' model of operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-scale-to-hyperlocal-communities&quot;&gt;How to scale to hyperlocal communities?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many ecommerce ventures have identified the potential of tier two and tier three townships of India and have attempted to venture in the untapped market, though more often than not with limited success or heavy losses. &lt;strong&gt;Grofers&lt;/strong&gt; , a major market player in e-commerce groceries had to close its operations in 9 tier two Indian cities due to logistical issues and unsustainable losses. &lt;strong&gt;Bigbasket&lt;/strong&gt; is also struggling to manage losses in hyperlocal communities despite having deep pockets. Despite their hold on markets in metros, startups have struggled in hyperlocal communities as they fail to adopt to new challenges.The following points hold key solutions to scaling in hyperlocal communities in India:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;platforms-ease-of-usage&quot;&gt;Platform's Ease of Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a large proportion of internet users in metropolitan cities, users in tier two, tier three and rural regions are more likely to have started internet usage in the last two years, as per Morgan Stanley. This directly affects their navigatibility and usage comfort on websites and in mobile applications. This upskilling in tier one cities is largely because of increased exposure to technology rather than any concentrated up-skilling initiative. Hence, before expanding to hyperlocal communities, e-commerce ventures must ensure that their platform is easy to use and navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government of India, in its 2018 budget, allocated INR 10,000 Cr for the development of telecom infrastructure. However, currently, many businesses are making 'Lite' versions of their apps to suit the needs of tier two and tier three markets and work within their internet speed constraints. Ola Cabs has one such 'Lite' app that doesn't use as much internet data by minimizing the load on GPS and maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transcending-the-language-barrier&quot;&gt;Transcending the Language Barrier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has immense vernacular diversity, and although English is largely accepted as a means of communication for online purchases and transactions in urban metropolis, the same cannot be said about tier two and tier three cities. To truly reach out to such hyperlocal communities, making one's platform available in local languages is sure shot strategy that guarantees returns and also puts one miles ahead of competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mobile-optimisation&quot;&gt;Mobile Optimisation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In continuation with the platform's ease of usage, optimisation for smartphone's is essential as an overwhelming majority of users in hyperlocal communities access internet through their mobile devices. This can be achieved through websites designed to render on smartphones and mobile applications available for download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multiple-payment-options&quot;&gt;Multiple Payment Options&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has 30.86 million credit cards and 880 million debit cards as of 2017, while the debit card penetration is high, it's usage still remains dismally low in rural regions for online transactions. With the launch of Unified Payments' Interface (UPI) and increasing popularity of mobile wallets that are easier to control and operate, e-commerce ventures should ensure that they provide multiple payment options to cater to a wide variety of customers and ensure that the payment process is in their comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cash-on-delivery&quot;&gt;Cash on Delivery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a fast developing financial infrastructure, high debit card penetration and the launch of UPI, trust remains low in online transactions for users based in hyperlocal communities. The absence of Cash on Delivery as a payment option often ends up being a dealbreaker for online purchases, hence, an e-commerce startup looking to scale in hyperlocal communities must accept Cash on Delivery as a mode of payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;customer-service&quot;&gt;Customer Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More often than not, company warehouses, local offices and servicing headquarters for e-commerce firms are located in large metropolises; this results in delayed delivery of product, comparatively poorer customer service and experience for customers from tier two and tier three cities. E-commerce ventures must ensure that measure are taken to ensure that customer experience for non-urban regions remains at par with metro cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;targeted-inventory&quot;&gt;Targeted Inventory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An e-commerce venture launching in hyperlocal communities much model its inventory to suit the requirements and demands of local customers. Continuous modifications, upgradations and stocking of the inventory based on user feedback and demand assessment will enable an e-commerce firm to properly gauge and respond to local interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-enhancement-of-buying-experience&quot;&gt;Technical Enhancement of Buying Experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovations such as 'Style Studio' - &lt;strong&gt;Myntra's&lt;/strong&gt; virtual trial room, &lt;strong&gt;Lenskart's&lt;/strong&gt; 3D Try On among others aim to bring the experience of shopping online as close to real world experiences as possible. Such methods instill a sense of familiarity and comfort in users, especially first time users who are hesitant to spend online. Any new venture in e-commerce must look at technologies such as 360 degree AR/VR, 3D modelling among others to bring their inventories as close to the real world as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

Don’t take my word for it, search for yourself, but the fact largely stands. Reports published in the BBC, Psychology Today, Vogue and various other sources hold consensus. In this article, I discuss a theory that attempts to explain this rather unfortunate and curious phenomenon. Its called a crisis of extremes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a world where our senses are bombarded by information at all times. News, Social Media, smartphones, from Trump’s tweets to your friends’ instagram stories, we get to know things faster than ever before in human history. It’s pretty amazing, hands down, endless possibilities, a testament to human endeavour and what not. But there is one catch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t post everything. Not all parts of our lives are online, we post the &lt;em&gt;highlights&lt;/em&gt;, and so does everyone else. Our news broadcasts, social media stories and feeds are all &lt;em&gt;highlights&lt;/em&gt; of human lives that, now, are instantly accessible to us. And what do we do? We compare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put ourselves right up there on a pedestal, next to our feeds and wait for our turn in limelight, our shot at greatness. Because everyone elses’ life is great, they are all at beach parties with their friends. The rickshaw-puller’s daughter just cracked the public service examination and a distant cousin found purpose in life while on an year long trip across eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely. Surely your moment under the sun is right around the corner. That one startup idea you had while taking that extra-long shower is what’s going to turn it all around for you, exactly like that guy from Forbes 30 under 30 who’s changing the world. Start working on your TED talk already. Or write a book? Everyone’s getting published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a generation that has gotten used to the extraordinary.&lt;br /&gt;
Fascinated by it. Bored of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to quote the acclaimed novelist &lt;em&gt;Chuck Palahniuk&lt;/em&gt;, in a beautiful satire on the modern culture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War’s a spiritual war… our Great Depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won’t. And we’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. That’s from &lt;em&gt;Fight Club&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Chuck Palahniuk&lt;/em&gt; wrote &lt;em&gt;Fight Club&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our generation carries a higher level of perfectionism and expectations than ever before in human history. Though how that’s working out for us is an entirely different story. It isn’t really much of a surprise then that the United States, a country that probably has the largest set of examples for individual success stories, a nation that identifies itself with a dream where values of perfectionism, perseverance and great expectations are awarded with personal success, is worst hit by adolescent and young adult depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s probably not going to be the premise of the next Black Mirror episode, but this face of the information revolution deserves our attention nonetheless. Our great war might just be a spiritual one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article aims to analyse the current Indian Banking Crisis due to non-performing assets of corporate defaulters, identify the motivation and cause for the gradual increase in the number of defaulters for NPAs in India, and suggest possible remedies and changes to alleviate the present situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indian Banking sector was thriving on a wave of optimism that had it roots in the progressive growth rates of mid 2000s, companies were borrowing aggressively for expansion, and banks were trusting, and lenient with their lending rates. Then the Lehman Brothers market crash of 2008 happened, and it severely decapitated repayment abilities in the corporate sector, and banks had to bear the brunt of losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the decade following 2008, the Indian Banking sector has put itself in a precarious situation, owing to bad loans being sanctioned primarily because of lapses in due diligence. A noteworthy point is the lack of transparency in third party agencies like surveyors and financial analysts, on whom lending banks rely to a significant extent for assuring critical financial information, application status of funds, among other due diligence. These agencies are subject to malpractices and manipulation with little scrutiny and play a pivotal role in getting funds to corporations with inferior and non-liquidable collateral by falsifying their credit score.
As per data released by the Reserve Bank of India, over the course of last five financial years, Indian Banks have had to write of loans worth $38.8 billion, largely due to corporate defaulters. This, in turn, has resulted the government injecting $40.3 billion dollars in government-owned banks, to sustain them. Every rupee that goes into these banks is taken away from more important areas like agriculture, education, healthcare and defence. The rise in number of wilful defaulters, and percentage of bad loans in PSBs is alarming, and mitigations are needed to curtail the exploitation of an allegedly slow Judicial System, and corruption at high levels of bureaucracy and banking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;present-scenario&quot;&gt;Present Scenario&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s gross NPAs or non-performing assets held by lending institutions in the country including co-operatives and small banks in addition to government and private banks, stands at 9.6% as per RBI’s 2017 Financial Stability Report. Amongst major economies of the world, India has the second highest ratio of NPAs. China, whose growth is based on borrowings, has only 1.7% NPAs according to the IMF Soundness Indicators. Only Italy, with 16.4% NPAs has more stressed assets, aside from debt-ridden countries such as Ukraine and Greece that have 30.5% and 36.3% NPAs respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/banking-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stats-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alarming fact is, that of the gross NPAs of India, around 14 percent of these bad loans in PSBs are due to wilful defaulters. The total gross NPAs of 21 PSBs stood at Rs 7.33 lakh crore as on September 30, 2017. Whereas, Rs 1.01 lakh crore of loans were termed as those in wilful default in some of the largest PSBs, by corporate defaulters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/banking-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stats-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to a question raised on the Parliament floor, in August 2017, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley stated that gross NPAs of PSBs increased by 311.22% in the four year period from Rs.1,55,890 crores in 2013 to Rs. 6,41,057 crores 2017. An unanticipated revelation was that exponential increase in NPAs is not a phenomenon limited to PSBs, even private sector banks witnessed an increase in NPAs from 19,968 crores in 2013, o 73,842 crores in 2017.
A multitude of Public Sector Banks have been posting staggering losses in the past few quarters, due to loan frauds, wilful defaults, and write-offs. Recently, Canara Bank approached CBI for a loan fraud amounting to Rs.500 crores, while Andhra Bank posted losses of 532 crores in the 3rd quarter of FY18 due to write-offs for bad loans. In the same financial year, Corporation Bank posted a standalone loss of Rs.1240 crores, while SBI lost Rs. 2,416 crores in Q3 for FY18 with its NPAs alone rising to Rs. 2 lakh crores. Following this dismal trend are Central Bank of India with losses of Rs. 1,664 crores, UCO Bank with Rs. 1,016 crores lost, and Syndicate Bank with losses of Rs. 870 crores in Q3 of FY18.
A noteworthy point is, that these enormous losses, instead of causing issues for stakeholders, rather push the bank’s stocks further up, as investor confidence is boosted with the belief that the bank is cleaning up bad loans from its books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As put in words by former RBI deputy governor K.C. Chakrabarty in 2013, “PSBs suffer from some structural deficiencies related to the management and governance arrangements. Instances of lax credit management (credit appraisal, credit supervision, etc.,) and poor governance and management standards which, though persisting even before the crisis, were not dealt with in time and, eventually, impacted much more emphatically than was anticipated.” Not much has been done since 2013, even though reformatory measures and laws have been in the bureaucratic pipeline, to curb poor credit management in India, which can be seen as a direct cause for the present number of wilful defaulters and the recent high profile cases of credit frauds emerging in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;parallels-in-high-profile-cases&quot;&gt;Parallels in High-Profile Cases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;punjab-national-bank-2018&quot;&gt;Punjab National Bank, 2018&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a provision of bank guarantee known as a letter of undertaking (LOU) under which a bank can allow its customer to raise money from another Indian bank’s foreign branch in the form of a short term credit. The LOU serves the purpose of a bank guarantee. But, to receive such an LOU, the customer is supposed to pay a margin to the bank on the basis of which, a credit limit for the customer is set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Punjab National Bank Fraud Case relates to alleged fraudulent Letter of Undertaking worth ₹11,600 crore that took place at its branch in Brady House, Mumbai, making Punjab National Bank potentially liable for the amount. The fraudulent transactions are linked to designer and jeweler Nirav Modi of Gitanjali Group, against whom a complaint has been filed with the Central Bureau of Investigation which is currently investigating the scam apart from ED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this case, while issuing the LOUs, neither were Nirav Modi’s firms Diamond R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds asked to pay a margin, nor was a Credit limit set for them to raise money. These severe departures from due diligence were the result of PNB employees being bribed by the accused party over a ten year period starting in 2008. The sidelining of existing norms to prevent such a fraud by corruption of lower level employees is what made this siphoning off of money possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The bank said that two of its employees at the branch were involved in the scam, when the bank’s core banking system was bypassed when the corrupt employees issued LOUs to overseas branches of other Indian banks, including Allahabad Bank, Axis Bank, and Union Bank of India, using the international financial communication system, SWIFT. Three Jewellers - Gitanjali Gems Ltd and its subsidiaries Gili and Nakshatra are also under the scanner of investigation agencies. Nirav Modi fled the nation before CBI filed a query against him, and at the time of writing this report, is still at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kingfisher-wilful-default-2016&quot;&gt;Kingfisher Wilful Default, 2016&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Vijay Mallya, the ex-chairman of United Spirits Ltd, and the erstwhile Kingfisher Airlines, defrauded 17 Indian banks of a net ₹9,000 crores in wilful default of loans over non-performing assets. Prominent Indian PSBs were among Kingfisher’s lenders,  including the State Bank of India and IDBI Bank being among others.
In 2010, Kingfisher Airlines pledged its brand as collateral to raise money from PSBs for the airlines survival in the face of mounting losses. The valuation of this brand was done by Grant Thornton, India, and resulting reports helped Kingfisher raise 3 times its market capitalisation. This brand-value was grossly inflated, and other personal assets put in collateral by Mallya were neither liquid, nor sufficient to justify the loaned amount. With operations failing, Kingfisher closed shop in February 2012, and later declared bankruptcy, defaulting on its loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Allegations of misappropriation of wealth, money-laundering and tax-evasion, along with wilful default, have also been levied against Mallya, while all his Indian assets have been seized and are being auctioned to recover the bad loans given out to him. Despite the revocation of his Indian Passport and repeated summons from the Supreme Court of India, in light of ongoing investigations against him by the ED and CBI, Mallya is presently in United Kingdom, with a lengthy and often unsuccessful extradition process being pursued by the Indian authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Grant Thornton is being investigated for its unscrupulously inflated valuation of the Kingfisher brand by the Serious Frauds Investigation Office (SFIO), with this being another instance of a third party playing a crucial role in PSBs being defrauded by corporate behemoths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The inability of government and financial machinery to successfully reprimand Mallya in due time directly resulted in the formulation of the The Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill of 2017 that adds teeth to financial institutions in tackling high profile wilful defaulters. The &lt;strong&gt;Amendments to the Recovery of Debts due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act of 1993 (RDDBFI), 2016&lt;/strong&gt; was also made to assist the recovery of Kingfisher loans by auctioning Mallya stressed assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;winsome-diamond-group-fraud-2013&quot;&gt;Winsome Diamond Group Fraud, 2013&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jatin Mehta was a known face in the banking world in the early 2000s who took credit to purchase gold, turned it into diamond studded jewelry and sold it to clients based in Dubai. The model of this approach ensured that Mehta’s companies enjoyed high credit scores. The Winsome Diamond Group had taken a loan of Rs 6,800 crore from a consortium of banks led by the Standard Chartered Bank. Of the total loan amount, PNB has the highest exposure of Rs 1,800 crore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here, the lenders had issued standby letters of credit in favour of international bullion banks to supply gold to Winsome Group companies. The letter of credit was an understanding between Indian banks and the international bullion banks that if the Winsome Group failed to pay the bullion banks, the Indian lenders would pay for the gold purchase. Eventually, the Diamond Group failed to pay the bullion banks, citing significant losses in the Gulf region. In 2013, the Diamond Group defaulted on loans with the bank consortium labelling the group a Wilful Defaulter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The faults identified on Indian Bank’s part were irregularities in due diligence done, developments in Mehta’s holding companies were not assessed by Indian Banks. This negligence on part of Indian Banks, whether wilful or not, falsified the credit score of Mehta’s companies, and resulted in the largest bank default of its time in India. Board members of PNB was reprimanded by investigation agencies for the negligence of its board in approval of loans, and the Indian Companies Act of 2013 added liability for Board of Directors of a Company in the event that fraud or corruption on the company’s behalf is proven in a court of law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ketan-parekh-2001&quot;&gt;Ketan Parekh, 2001&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ketan Parekh was Harshad Mehta’s protege, and he replicated his methodologies of defraudment: illegal diversion of funds from banks through forged documents to sustain equity market positions. Parekh obtained pay-orders from Ahmedabad-based Madhavpura Mercantile Cooperative Bank without providing sufficient collateral. He would discount these pay-orders with Bank of India in Mumbai and use the proceeds to ramp up shares. Parekh’s operation ultimately collapsed when his favourite stocks were hammered by traders and Mercantile Cooperative outstanding pay-orders exceeded its ability to repay Bank of India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sanjay-aggrawal-2000&quot;&gt;Sanjay Aggrawal, 2000&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sanjay Agarwal was former CEO of Lloyds Brokerage, and was responsible for the  creation of the portal Home Trade in 2000. Agarwal inserted himself into the world of cooperative banks, promising to invest in gilts on their behalf and delivering lucrative trading returns. Instead, he diverted the money without delivering the securities or providing the promised returns. The charade continued till one of the cooperative banks complained about not receiving the promised securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;harshad-mehta-1992&quot;&gt;Harshad Mehta, 1992&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Harshad Mehta exploited the manual and antiquated settlement systems in trading of government securities. With the assistance of a few pliant bank officers, Mehta conducted fraudulent trades between different banks using forged documents and diverted proceeds to prop up unattainable equities positions in multiple stocks. The scam affected large public sector banks such as the State Bank of India, foreign banks with the likes of Standard Chartered, small private banks like Bank of Karad, which is now non-existent, multiple corporate heads, and securities exchange intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A slew of reforms were pushed, in an attempt to modernise the Indian trading ecosystem, starting with the Securities Law Amendment Act of 1995, that fixed several of the gaping loopholes that Mehta abused for illegitimate gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple parallels can be drawn by an in-depth analysis of all of these high-profile cases that grabbed the eye of mass media. Primarily, either unethical usage of existing system loopholes was undertaken by individuals with the assistance of forged documents and low-level financial institution employees who were party to the crime, or existing systems and frameworks to avoid such a financial misdemeanour were illegally evaded by bribing institution officials and using larger-than-life personas to curtail regulations. Third party agencies, such as financial surveyors, auditors and consultancy firms that PSBs rely upon, were found to be subject to manipulation and were abused in multiple of these high-profile cases, to misrepresent financial details of loan applicants, inflate assets among other coordinated frauds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes at both institutional and constitutional levels were brought in, during the aftermath of these infamous cases, the laws passed are listed in the summarised legal remedies section that follows, while institutional remedies include additional layers of authentication in Securities trading, involvement of an external and theoretically neutral third party agency to achieve a credit score rating for applicant entity, increased multiplayer protection for validation of transactions among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the sweeping reforms brought in, the banking industry finds itself in a poor state today due to severe fallacies in execution. Due diligence is not followed for a multitude of high-profile clients by banks in an attempt to increase their top-tier customer base, which has recently proven to be catastrophic for many PSBs. These misdoings are largely avoidable by making creditory regulations ironclad and strengthening the structure of our financial institutions, while also ensuring proper paperwork and systematic processing of all loans and request irrespective of the personnel involved. In most of the cases, had all existing regulations been strictly adhered too, fraudulent credit and subsequent default could have been avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summarised-legal-remedies&quot;&gt;Summarised Legal Remedies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;financial-resolution-and-deposit-insurance-frdi-bill-2017&quot;&gt;Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FRDI Bill of 2017 aims at streamlining and strengthening the current structure and framework of deposit insurance, significantly benefitting the retail depositors. The Finance Ministry states that the bill seeks to protect customers of financial service providers in times of financial distress, while inculcating discipline among financial service providers in the event of financial crises, by limiting the use of public money to bail out distressed entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s claimed that the bill would help in maintaining financial stability in the economy by ensuring adequate preventive measures, while at the same time providing the necessary instruments for dealing with crisis events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amendments-to-the-securitization-and-reconstruction-of-financial-assets-and-enforcement-of-security-interest-act-of-2002-sarfaesi-2016&quot;&gt;Amendments to The Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act of 2002 (SARFAESI), 2016&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SARFAESI Act of 2002 enables banks and other financial institutions to auction residential or commercial properties of defaulters to recover loans, and reduce their non-performing assets by adopting measures of recovery or reconstruction. Upon a loan default, the bank is within legal rights to seize securities without any intervention by any court of law. A court of law needs to be approached only in the event of the property in consideration being unsecured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amendments-to-the-recovery-of-debts-due-to-banks-and-financial-institutions-act-of-1993-rddbfi-2016&quot;&gt;Amendments to the Recovery of Debts due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act of 1993 (RDDBFI), 2016&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Amendment to  RDDBFI Act of 1993, now Banks and asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) will be allowed to convert any part of the debt of the defaulting company into equity. Such a conversion would imply that lenders or ARCs would tend to become an equity holder rather than being a creditor of the company. The amendments also allow banks to bid for any immovable property they have put out for auction themselves, if they do not receive any bids during the auction. In such a scenario, banks will be able to adjust the debt with the amount paid for this property. This enables the bank to secure the asset in part fulfillment of the defaulted loan. Banks can then sell this property to a new bidder at a later date to clear off the debt completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;insolvency-and-bankruptcy-code-ibc-2016&quot;&gt;Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) is the bankruptcy law of India which seeks to consolidate the existing framework by creating a single law for insolvency and bankruptcy. The bankruptcy code is a one stop solution for resolving insolvencies which at present is a long process and does not offer an economically viable arrangement. A strong insolvency framework where the cost, time, incurred is minimised in attaining liquidation has been long overdue in India.  The code will be able to protect the interests of small investors and make the process of doing business a less cumbersome process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-fugitive-economic-offenders-bill-2017&quot;&gt;The Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill 2017 was first mentioned by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget speech in 2017-18, against the backdrop of bringing back Vijay Mallya, who owes over Rs 9,000 crore in the Kingfisher Airlines fraud case. The Bill primarily empowers the government and investigating agencies to confiscate property and assets of economic offenders and defaulters who flee India. It covers a wide range of offences, including wilful loan defaults, cheating and forgery, forged or fraudulent document of electronic records, duty evasion, non-repayment of deposits and others. The Bill also proposes setting up of a “Special Court” under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, which will declare a person a “fugitive economic offender”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/banking-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stats-3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special Committees follow scams, and scams follow special committees, this has been an unfortunate cycle in Indian Financial Institutions over the past few decades. The present context is alarming because today, India’s bad loans have grown to an extent that they can hold the country’s economic progress to ransom. While the economic output has slowed down over the past few quarters due to disruptive government measures such as Demonetisation and GST, gross NPA in Indian financial institutions has spiked from 5.884% in 2015 to 9.6% in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong legal measures are the need of the hour, adherence to due diligence, greater scrutiny of third parties involved in the assessment of a loan application, and institutional reforms to minimize the docility of employees and cohesion to established protocols. Suitable measures taken now can ensure that the vicious wheel of Committees and Scams in the Indian Financial Market could be broken once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
