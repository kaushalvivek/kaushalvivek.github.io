                        <h2>The Myers Briggs Theory</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>At the heart of Myers Briggs theory are four preferences. <br> Do you prefer to deal with:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> People and things (Extraversion or "E"), or ideas and information (Introversion or "I").</li>
                            <li>Facts and reality (Sensing or "S"), or possibilities and potential (Intuition or "N").</li>
                            <li>Logic and truth (Thinking or "T"), or values and relationships (Feeling or "F").</li>
                            <li>A lifestyle that is well-structured (Judgment or "J"), or one that goes with the flow (Perception or "P").</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Myers Briggs theory, for each pair you prefer one style more than the other. Jung also allowed a middle group where you like an equal balance of the two. You combine the letters associated with your preferences to get your Myers Briggs personality type.
                        For example, having preferences for E, S, T and J gives a personality type of ESTJ. Although you have preferences, you still use all eight styles - in the same way that most people are right-handed but they still use both hands.</p>
                    <p><b><em>Extraversion and Introversion -</em></b> The first pair of styles is concerned with the direction of your energy. If you prefer to direct your energy to deal with people, things, situations, or "the outer world", then your preference
                        is for Extraversion. If you prefer to direct your energy to deal with ideas, information, explanations or beliefs, or "the inner world", then your preference is for Introversion.</p>
                    <p><b><em>Sensing and Intuition -</em></b> The second pair concerns the type of information/things that you process. If you prefer to deal with facts, what you know, to have clarity, or to describe what you see, then your preference is
                        for Sensing. If you prefer to deal with ideas, look into the unknown, to generate new possibilities or to anticipate what isn't obvious, then your preference is for Intuition. The letter N is used for intuition because I has already
                        been allocated to Introversion.</p>
                    <p><b><em>Thinking and Feeling -</em></b> The third pair reflects your style of decision-making. If you prefer to decide on the basis of objective logic, using an analytic and detached approach, then your preference is for Thinking. If
                        you prefer to decide using values - i.e. on the basis of what or who you believe is important - then your preference is for Feeling.</p>
                    <p><b><em>Judgment and Perception -</em>
                        </b> The final pair describes the type of lifestyle you adopt. If you prefer your life to be plannedand well-structured then your preference is for Judging. This is not to be confused with 'Judgmental', which is quite different.
                        If you prefer to go with the flow, to maintain flexibility and respond to things as they arise, then your preference is for Perception.</p>
                    <p>When you put these four letters together, you get a personality type code. Having four pairs to choose from means there are sixteen Myers Briggs personality types.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s brilliant, and largely accurate, there&rsquo;s no arguing that.</p>
                    <p> But my observation is that personality traits vary when there is a variation in mood and time. The conclusion I draw from it is that people do not fall in specific personality roles. It&rsquo;s more of a venn diagram, with people falling
                        in intersections, and behaving in coherence with respective personalities based on environmental variables, that is, the circumstances they are pushed into. I present an analysis done on myself over the course of 6 months to substantiate
                        my findings and proposals. Over the planned course, and under different emotional states, my results varied significantly.</p>
                    <p>Traits that varied:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Energy</li>
                            <li>Tactics</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Traits that remained relatively unchanged:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mind</li>
                            <li>Nature</li>
                            <li>Identity</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>There was a considerable shift in Energy from Observant to Intuitive while a shift from Judging to Prospecting was also observed over the duration in Tactics. Mind remained largely unaltered, with spikes of introversion based on emotional
                        state. While Thinking was a constant, I am as Practical as I always was with a disregard for human emotion to a certain extent.(Yay me) Identity remained a constant. No change whatsoever.<br/> These subtle fluctuations resulted
                        in my personality being classified as:<br/><b><br/> 
                            <a href = "https://www.16personalities.com/estj-personality" target = "_blank">ESTJ</a>
                        <br /><a href = "https://www.16personalities.com/estp-personality" target = "_blank">ESTP</a>
                        <br/><a href = "https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality" target = "_blank">ENTP</a></b></p>
                    <p>Over the duration. Now I talked to people who know me, and they concurred that I probably am an amalgamation of these characteristics in reality, that goes on to prove my venn diagram hypothesis. I am also curious in finding the truth
                        hidden in statements like <em>&ldquo;Birds of a feather flock together&rdquo;</em>; and <em>&ldquo;Opposites Attract&rdquo;</em> and am now making illegal human subjects out of my closest friends to present my conclusions.</p>
                    <p>Stay tuned. :)</p>
