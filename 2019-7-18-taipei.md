*This post marks the start of a new series : **The Metropolis Project**, in which I hope to travel the world to experience life in the the greatest urban centres on this planet, cities that are unique in certain respects, and write about my experience.*

This post, is about *Taipei*.

I am not a fan of architecture per se, but I can faintly trace my fascination with skyscrapers to late 2005, flipping through an edition of Whitaker's World Fact-book, there was a list of top 10 tallest buildings in the world, and right there on the top was Taipei 101, the world's tallest skyscraper in 2005, along with a picture. *509 meters, wow* as a kid, I couldn't imagine a building half a kilometer high, it sounded incredible. I wanted to see it to be sure. And right there, right then, it was my earliest itch to travel. A lasting memory.

Years later, Taipei 101 is no longer the tallest building in the world, but I never really got over that initial fascination. It was never just about a building, it was about what it represented to me, a very early impression of what we as a species can achieve. So when an opportunity presented itself, a chance to work at the National Taiwan University, Taipei, for a couple of months, I jumped at it.

So I packed my bags and came to Taiwan. 4000 kms from home. For two months. A stranger in the country. Unable to speak the language. Unsure of the food, unsure of the culture, unsure of a purpose. The funny this is that I was never scared. I became aware of the fact that it was a *brave* thing to do when people I talked to dropped their jaws over there in Taipei. I was excited, right from the moment I landed in Taiwan. I looked at the city from my Airport train window, at the buildings, the hills, a faint silhouette of Taipei 101 in the background, and the only thing I could feel was a rush of adrenaline. I've never felt more alive.

I don't want to bore you mid-way through this post, so I'll limit myself to a select few points, along with pictures. So I guess this would be the template for future posts in **The Metropolis Project**.
